With fluorescent Christmas cheer

Give out messages of hope

Underneath the pretty lies

"Where is the sun,  
The sun that used to shine on me?  
Where has it gone  
Or is it just a memory?  
  
I looked through the window,  
Staring at the sky,  
Waiting for a moment  
That always passed me by.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Black summer rain,  
Black summer rain,  
Black summer rain is falling on me, girl.  
  
Where is the love,  
The love I need to set me free?  
And how can I escape  
This gloom that is swallowing me?

"When the sun rose this morning  
I didn't have my baby by my side  
When the sun rose this morning  
I didn't have my baby by my side  
I don't know where she was  
I know she's out with some another guy  
Don't the sun look lonesome  
Shadin' down behind the trees?  
Don't the sun look lonesome  
Shadin' down behind the trees?  
But don't your house look lonesome  
When your baby's packed to leave?  
Blow wind, blow wind  
Blow my baby back to me  
Blow wind, blow wind  
Blow my baby back to me  
Well you know if I don't soon find her, I will be in misery  
Goodbye baby that is all I have left to say  
Ohh, goodbye baby, that is all I have left to say  
But you have lost your good thing  
Go ahead and have your own way

"Don't take the wrong direction passing through  
Instead of deep reflection of what's true  
For it's a combination of judgments made by you  
That cause a deep dejection all the way through  
  
No relaxation, no conversation, no variation  
In a very dark blue, blue condition  
  
Early rising every day  
You must be enterprising in your way  
For you will hear no laughter, nor see the sun  
Life would be one disaster all the way through

In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light  
You're comin' through to me in black and white  
When we were made of dreams.  
You're blowing down the shaky street  
You're hearing my heart beat  
In the record breaking heat  
Where we were born in time.  
Not one more night not one more kiss  
Not this time baby no more of this  
Takes too much skill takes too much will  
It's revealing.  
You came you saw, just like the law  
You married young, just like your ma,  
You tried and tried, you made me slide  
You left me reelin' with this feelin'.  
On the rising curve  
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,  
You won't get anything you don't deserve  
Where we were born in time.  
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,  
You hang the flame, you'll pay the price,  
Oh babe, that fire  
Is still smokin'.  
You were snow, you were rain  
You were striped, you were plain,  
Oh babe, truer words  
Have not been spoken or broken.  
In the hills of mystery,  
In the foggy web of destiny,  
You can have what's left of me,  
Where we were born in time.

My TV is broke, said I'm out of smoke, there's no one I can even call.

In wanting you to stay here with me.  
I know you've got somewhere to go,  
But won't you make yourself at home and stay with me?

Lay down, Sally, and rest you in my arms.  
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?  
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon.  
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you.

And we still got the moon and stars above.  
Underneath the velvet skies,  
Love is all that matters. Won't you stay with me?  
And don't you ever leave.

Coloring your face so dreamily.  
So don't you go and say goodbye,  
You can lay your worries down and stay with me.  
And don't you ever leave.

You say you love him loud and plain

To tell me which way I should go to find the answer,  
And all the time I know,

Trying hard to get a friend that I can count on,  
But there's nothing left to show,  
Plant your love and let it grow

Let it blossom, let it flow  
In the sun, the rain, the snow,  
Love is lovely, so let it grow, let it grow  
  
Time is getting shorter and there's much for you to do  
Only ask and you will get what you are needing,  
The rest is up to you  
Plant your love and let it grow  
  
Let it grow, let it grow,  
Let it blossom, let it flow  
In the sun, the rain, the snow,  
Love is lovely, let it  
  
Let it grow, let it grow,  
Let it blossom, let it flow  
In the sun, the rain, the snow,

I had to live the life of a lonely one.

Discovering love could be so true  
When shared by two, 'stead of only one.  
  
When you said you loved me  
We could not be parted.  
Said, I built my world around you  
And I'm truly glad I found you  
  
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.  
I never felt so good before.  
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.  
Yes it has, you know it has.  
  
Each night I pray we'll never part  
Because the love within my heart  
Grows stronger from day to day.  
Best I try, hard I try  
To reassure and satisfy.  
You know I'd be lost if you went away.  
  
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.  
Yes it has, I know it has.  
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.  
  
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.  
I never felt so good before.  
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.
