"And the band began to play, without a song they'd lose their way  
A song of love and custom dreams, a song of yesterday  
When they danced, when they danced, her skirts were lifted high  
She felt the music in his arms, the danger in his eyes  
And a woman said no, and a man said ""but I love you so""  
And a woman moved closer, and a man said ""Take my love into your heart  
I must have you here by my side""  
  
It happened all too fast, they came to love and they came to last  
No-one remembers now who lied, true love is made of glass  
And a woman said ""change"", and a man said ""as soon as I can""  
And a woman said ""open up"", and a man said  
""Your way's right, you're my love, I won't be holdin' you down""  
  
In the evening of their lives, no regrets and clear blue skies  
They meet again in old New York, he tells her one sweet lie  
  
And they danced and they danced, and a man said ""I love you so""  
And a woman moved closer, and a man said ""take my love into your heart  
I must have you here by my side""

"We search for an answer,  
And when it appears  
We can challenge the world with our sweat and our tears.  
Through winning and losing,  
The brave never bend,  
The hero keeps fighting, standing tall in the end.  
  
Time can change anything... And mend any fall.  
The moment of truth is facing us all,  
It's time for the hero to stand tall.  
  
It's a time for heroes,  
Time to answer the call,  
It's a time for the hero in us all.  
  
We carry the flame  
For all to see  
The fire and the passion, of what we can be.  
Sometimes we must fight,  
But we never bend  
The hero keeps fighting, standing tall in the end.  
  
Love can change anything... It's inside of us all  
To reach out a hand whenever we fall.  
It's time for the hero to stand tall.  
  
It's a time for heroes,  
Time to answer the call,  
It's a time for the hero to stand tall.  
It's a time for heroes,  
When our back's to the wall  
It's a time for the hero... In us all.

"I'm still alive  
Must have been a miracle  
It's been a hell of ride  
Destination still unknown  
It's a fact of life,  
If you make one wrong move with the gun to your head  
You better walk the line or you'll be left for dead  
  
I'm a runaway train on broken track  
I'm a ticker on a bomb, you can't turn back this time  
That's right  
I got away with it all and I'm still alive  
Let the end of the world come tumbling down  
I'll be the last man standing on the ground  
As long as I got blood rush trough my veins  
I'm still alive  
  
Lost in the night  
Feeling so invisible  
Oh, a dead man walking the wire  
I have broke the devils net  
That's made of fire  
And it's a long way down from the top of the world  
You better look around or you gonna get burned  
  
I'm a runaway train on broken track  
I'm a ticker on a bomb, you can't turn back this time  
That's right  
I got away with it all and I'm still alive  
Let the end of the world come tumbling down  
I'll be the last man standing on the ground  
And as the dust wheels look in my eyes  
I'm still alive  
I'm still alive  
  
The darkest night ain't black enough  
To keep the morning light from shinin'  
The highest wall ain't tall enough  
To keep the smallest man from climbin'  
  
The more that you resist the tide  
The more it pulls you in  
The more you hang on for your life  
  
(I'm a runaway train on broken track)  
(I'm a ticker on a bomb, you can't turn back this time)

I'm a runaway train on broken track  
I'm a ticker on a bomb, you can't turn back this time  
That's right  
I got away with it all and I'm still alive  
Let the end of the world come tumbling down  
I'll be the last man standing on the ground  
And if my saddle is all that survives  
I'm still alive  
I'm still alive

"Love's an hourglass, it goes out wide then it comes in closer  
Time ticks away, it drifts away leaving empty shattered moments  
Who said that love could last forever?

As we sail away, feelin' comfort in the distance  
  
You said that love would last forever

A change of heart, about face

A shadow in the doorway beckons me inside  
And something led the way though I could not see its face  
And a voice from deep inside me screamed to get out of this place  
Above my head, all was said as the jailor turned the key on me  
He said you're not running out, no you're not leaving now

When you dressed up sharp and you felt alright  
It don't seem the same since cosmic light  
Came into my life, I thought I was divine  
I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go  
And listen to the music on the radio  
A saxophone was blowing on a Rock and Roll show  
We climbed in the back seat, really had a good time  
  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
Really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie, bless my soul

My head used to swim from the perfume I smelled  
My hands kinda fumbled with her white plastic belt  
I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt  
She'd whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine  
Get back in front and put some hair oil on  
Buddy Holly was singing his very last song  
With your arms around your girl, you try to sing along  
It felt pretty good, woo!  
Really had a good time

Watch you smile while you are sleeping,

I could stay lost in this moment forever,  
When every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure,

I don't wanna fall asleep,

I'd still miss you babe,

Lying close to you,  
Feeling your heart beating,  
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming,  
Wondering if it's me you're seeing,

And thank God we're together,  
I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever,

Make mountains move, crumble at your feet to get you through

That you'd never turn around and get locked up in another cage?  
Did you tear all the pictures of us living life together  
Did you burn all the memories that have been made in a fit of rage?  
Why don't you run away and find yourself alive  
Go on and turn the page before your lonely world collides

"From the minute I turned and laid my eyes on you, I had no eyes of my own

I gave you somewhere to live and then somebody to love  
You gave me nothing but trouble, man, I've been such a fool  
  
You gave me nothing at all, now let me give it to you  
You taught me how to be cruel, now let me try it on you  
  
How do you abuse me, let me count the ways  
How many hours in how many days  
How does it amuse you, let me count the pain  
How many rules breaking how many games

Go on and take all your stuff, don't even bother to pack  
In every way I want you out of my life  
But I'll kill you if you don't come back, I'll kill you if you don't come back  
  
In the pit of the night you used to pull me so close  
And then you'd hold me so tight  
And in the wink of an eye you used to give me it all  
And with a kiss in the darkness you'd deliver the light  
  
And in the pit of the night I hear you laughing so loud  
I know you're laughing at me  
Oh ain't it funny and sad the way I fell for your lies  
The way I fell into love and then I begged to be free  
  
You gave me nothing at all, now let me give it to you  
You taught me how to be cruel, now let me try it on you

"Long distance callin' in the middle of a rainy night  
So much static, hardly knew your voice  
An' you've been cryin', want me to love you like I did before  
Girl when it comes to you, you know I've got no choice  
  
You put a storm inside me, I want to head for a safer harbor  
They all tell me I should give you up, but no man coulda tried any harder  
Feels like an odyssey that's never gonna reach an end  
Every time I hear you callin' me, just want to feel you in my arms again  
  
[Chorus]  
Like a sailor to a siren, like a moth to a flame  
I know your love might be the death for me, but I run to you just the same  
Like a sailor to a siren, nothing's gonna keep us apart  
Crashin' over the wreckage of all the sailor's broken hearts  
  
Musta met you when we were livin' in another time  
Had nothin' but the jealous gods to point our way  
When men were sailors and a woman was a rocky shore  
Wailin' like a siren leadin' him astray  
  
I got another woman and I know you got another man  
They all tell me I should give you up, but I don't think that any mortal can  
Feels like an odyssey that's never gonna reach an end  
Every time I hear you callin' to me, just want to feel you in my arms again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gonna abandon ship, steal you from the cliff  
Take you to a place where the gods can't find us no more  
Let the sailors listen to the sirens if they dare  
Gonna be dancin' on the water, drownin' in your yellow hair

Leave the day and loose the light

A hero's waiting for the call  
And all the angels are waking up  
And all the devils start to fall

Every passion and desire  
Let your visions be outrageous  
Set your fantasies on fire

There'll be nothing left to fear  
I got the magic in your body  
Your inhibitions disappear  
  
You gotta curse the day: it's nothing but a merciless light  
So open up your arms and then you get down on your knees

Stem the tide of the rising waters

Dark days are pulling me forward  
And all the tears are washing over me  
I'm crying, lost forever  
In a future that ain't what it used to be  
No more no more no more

It's like a shadow on the land and the sea  
There's nothing so sad as  
A tomorrow gone bad

And those would be the good days for me  
Nothing gets to me now

Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
I know that you and I we got better things to do  
I don't know who you are or what you do, or where you go when you're not
around  
I don't know anything about you baby, but you're everything I'm dreaming of  
I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love  
A real dead ringer for love  
  
Ever since I can remember you been hanging 'round this joint  
You been trying to look away but now you finally got the point  
I don't have to know your name and I won't tell you what to do  
But a girl, she doesn't live by only rock 'n roll and brew  
  
Baby baby, baby baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You got the kind of legs that do more than walk  
  
I don't have to listen to your whimpering talk  
  
Listen you got the kind of eyes that do more than see  
  
You got a lotta nerve to come on to me  
  
You got the kind of lips that do more than drink  
  
You got the kind of mind that does less than think  
  
But since I'm feeling kinda lonely, my defenses are low  
Why don't you give it a shot and get it ready to go  
I'm looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction  
And I want to tell my daddy I'll be missing in action  
  
Ever since I can remember I've been hanging 'round this joint  
My daddy never noticed, now he'll finally get the point  
  
You got me beggin' on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone  
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone  
  
Baby baby, baby baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dead ringer for love  
  
[Repeat: x12]  
Dead ringer for love, dead ringer

"So this is what it feels like  
To be the one left behind  
To give it all you've got, then find  
You've already changed your mind  
  
And this is what it sounds like  
Crying on the bed that we both made  
Waiting for a sign that you just can't give me  
Any kind of sign  
  
I don't want to be here wide-awake  
Clinging to a love that can't be saved  
Hanging off the edge of every word  
That you say  
  
So I asked myself, ""Do I love you so much  
That I'm willing to let you go?""  
At the tip of my tongue the answer was ""yes""  
But, at the bottom of my heat I'm wondering  
  
Did I say that?  
Did I say that?  
Sometimes you know I over react  
And what I say is not a matter of fact  
I wish that I could take it all back  
  
And you know I'd drag myself through fire at your side  
And you know the gates of Heaven are surely open wide  
And I need some sympathy here  
And I need someone to call my own  
I'm standing in the light of my mistakes  
And begging you, ""come home.""  
  
And I know you need some time to run and hide  
But the truth is hard to swallow when you're choking on your pride  
  
So I asked myself, ""Do I love you so much  
That I'm willing to let you go?""  
At the tip of my tongue the answer was ""yes""  
But, at the back of my mind I'm wondering  
  
Did I say that?  
Did I say that?  
Sometimes you know I over react  
And what I say is not a matter of fact  
I wish that I could take it all back  
But I said that  
  
And I wish I could take it all back  
  
And I need some sympathy here  
And I want a love to call my own  
I want to take you in the back seat now  
And slowly drive you home  
  
And I know you need some time to run and hide  
But the truth is hard to swallow when you're  
Choking on your pride  
I don't want to be this wide-awake  
  
Fighting for a love that I can't save  
And hanging off the edge of every word you say  
Knowing that it might make me cry  
I don't want to be this complicating  
You can drag it out but I'll be waiting  
I stumbled on ""I love you"" tonight  
But it sounded like goodbye  
  
Did I say that?  
Did I say that?  
Did I tell you that I loved you cause if  
Would have been a matter of fact  
  
Did I say that?  
This time I'm not letting go  
Did I say that?  
This time I'll have and I'll hold  
Did I tell you that I loved you cause it  
Would have been a matter of fact  
Did I say that?  
This time I'm walking through fire  
Did I say that?  
This time I'll feed your desire  
Did I say that?  
This time I'll stand by your side  
Did I say that?  
This time I will be your pride  
Did I say that?  
This time I'm not letting go  
Did I say that?  
This time I'll have and I'll hold  
Did I say that?  
This time I'm walking through fire  
Did I say that?  
And I wish that I could take it all back  
  
So this is what it feels like  
To be the one left behind  
To give it all you've got then find  
That you've already changed your mind

"I still dream of you wakin' up, openin' your eyes  
Like a little girl I once knew  
Walkin' to the window, lookin' down on the street  
You walk with me, and I walk with you  
  
Well I thought it all over, it doesn't make any sense  
Why did it fall apart, when it seemed so innocent?  
You and I were like a light from a fallen star  
You can't go back, you can't run away from your heart  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't you look at me like that, 'cause I fall all over again  
And I just can't hold on to your love anymore  
Don't you look at me like that, 'cause I start all over again  
And it just can't be, like it was once before  
  
Don't stand there in the rain, lookin' like some long lost angel  
You and I were like a light from a fallen star  
You can't go back, you can't run away from your heart  
  
Don't stand there in the rain, lookin' like some long lost angel  
(No, I never could turn away from you)

"I stare in the mirror, my eyes refuse to blink  
Sympathy for me, hell I can't even think  
Send for the iceman, my temperature is startin' to rise  
I've heard it before 'n I know the truth from the lies  
  
[Chorus]  
Is it any wonder heaven's racked with thunder  
And all of my dreams go under like the fallin' rain  
Execution day, execution day (execution day, execution day) execution day  
Execution day  
  
Voices like locusts keep smothering me  
Twisting and turning my senses like a cyclone at sea  
Don't touch me now, won't let you crucify me  
You ain't no damn jury, you can't pass no sentence on me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whose blood on whose hands, where's the promises they preached for this land  
Standin' there with bibles clutched in their hand  
Whose blood on whose hands, whose blood on whose hands  
(Whose blood, whose hands)  
  
Execution day, execution day  
  
Father my hands are shakin', I see the light, it's breakin'  
Show me the way to set my soul free, I hope it rains on me  
Let it rain on me  
  
Execution day, execution day

"I took one look and something snapped inside,  
I said I love your eyes  
You took my heart, you took my breath away,  
I felt my temperature rise  
You said you've never loved a man this way  
That it was heaven you were here to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
And now you're just another fallen angel  
And I hope that the fall didn't do you no harm  
And now you're just another fallen angel  
Falling into somebody else's arms  
  
I took one look and I was paralyzed and was in paradise  
I must admit that when I first laid eyes,  
you had me hypnotized  
You said I'm sorry but I don't say much  
And I'm in heaven when I feel your touch  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Follow your own road baby, I'll be there when you need me  
To love and to comfort you  
And what he got ain't enough to keep you in the air  
I'll be there  
  
You said you've never loved a man this way  
That it was heaven you were here to stay

"She thought she had the only key  
She thought you only opened up to her, well you see  
I don't know why you call it love  
She thought she was the brightest light  
But someone else was lighting up your life, what I think  
I don't know why you call it love  
  
I'm not suspicious, no not me, but I'm not blind  
And I'd have to be not to see  
  
[Chorus]  
Gettin' away with murder, you can love a girl and hurt her  
That's gettin' away with, gettin' away with murder  
You can tell a girl you love her, while you're working on another  
That's gettin' away with, gettin' away with murder  
  
You have had to love and run  
Two in the hand has left you holding none, and I don't  
I don't know how you call it love, no, no  
  
You're not demanding, no not you, you're understanding  
You do what you want to do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You said she was the only one, but you were cheating all along  
There ought to be a law for what you've done  
  
I got to save you from yourself, I got to stop you from hurtin' someone else

"When the wind is howling through your window pane  
It's not the only pain of the night  
Your burning up in your bed, you gotta fever of love  
And there's not an antibody insight  
Hey jenny, jenny why are you crying  
There's a beauty of a moon in the sky  
But I guess when you've been leading such a sheltered life  
You never lift your head and look so high  
  
You don't have a lot  
But it's all that you've got  
And you can turn it into more than it seems  
Just give it a shot  
Fantasize every movement  
And imagine every inch of your dreams  
  
And no one said it had to be real  
But it's gotta be something you can reach out and feel now  
It ain't right  
It ain't fair  
Castles fall in the sand  
And we fade in the air  
And the good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere  
Ooh now good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere  
Sombody told me so  
Somebody told me now I know  
Every night in my prayers  
I'll be praying  
That the good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere  
  
When the sweat is sizzling  
On you skin in the dark  
And your desperate now for somewhere to turn  
  
Every muscle's in rebellion  
Every nerve is on edge  
And every limb is being erotically burned  
  
Hey johnny, johnny why are you shaking?  
When a boy should do whatever he can  
You've been nothing but an angel  
Every day of your life and now you wonder what it's like to be bad  
  
You don't have a lot  
But it's all that you've got  
And you can turn it into more than it seems  
Just give it a shot  
Fantasize every movement  
And imagine every inch of your dreams  
  
And no one said it had to be real  
But it's gotta be something you've been wanting to feel now  
It ain't right  
It ain't fair  
Castles fall in the sand  
And we fade in the air  
And the good boys go to heaven, but the bad boys go everywhere  
Good boys go to heaven, but the bad boys go everywhere  
Somebody told me so  
Somebody told me now I know  
Every night in my prayers  
I'll be praying  
That the good boys go to heaven, but the bad boys go everywhere  
  
Every time I try and dream you  
I can't believe how hard it's been to  
Conjure up your face and trace your body in the air  
All the seconds go on forever  
But the thirds and the forth ones are even better  
And every time I do it just a little bit longer  
Every time I dream, it's just a little bit stronger than  
Real life  
  
And no one said it had to be real  
But it's gotta be something you can reach out and feel now  
It ain't right  
It ain't fair  
Castles fall in the sand  
And we fade in the air  
And the good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere  
Ooh now good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere  
Somebody told me so  
Somebody told me now I know  
Every night in my prayers  
I'll be praying  
That the good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere

"Another New York waltz at four a.m.,  
In the canyons lost at night  
The city's just a jail for me, full of high rise prison walls  
And I'm riding through this darkness,  
'cause I know there's life within  
And I'm searching through the shadows,  
Just to find that light again  
  
Keep driving (keep driving),  
Let the meter run  
Keep driving (keep driving),  
Oh the night's not really done  
  
Keep driving  
  
And I'm hanging on a memory, and I feel it in the air  
I'm a prisoner of these lonely streets,  
But I know I'll find you there  
And oh Lord, you look so pretty,  
But you can see it in my eyes  
And just before my tear will fall, oh you smile and get inside  
It seems so real until the light turns green  
  
Don't wake me up, don't ruin this dream, don't take me from my scene  
  
Keep driving, keep driving,  
Keep driving, keep driving,  
I can't go home, don't take me home, I can't go home alone  
  
They don't tell you when the music stops,  
Or how the movie ends  
Is it too late once the feeling's gone,  
To back it up and start it all again?  
  
Oh Lord you look so pretty,  
And you can see it in my eyes  
And just before that tear will fall, oh you smile and get inside  
  
(Keep driving) keep driving, driving  
  
I can't go home, don't take me home, I can't go home alone  
  
(Keep driving) let the meter run,  
(keep driving) don't take me home  
  
(Keep driving) ooh, the night's still young  
  
(Keep driving) I gotta find someone,  
(keep driving) I gotta find someone,  
(Keep driving) I gotta find someone,  
(keep driving) I gotta find someone,

"Well, I went home with the waitress  
You know the way I always do  
Well how was I to know  
She was with the Russians, too  
I was gambling in Havana  
You know I took a little risk

Batten down, baby, lock all doors

Your hait's so straight, I can make it curl  
There's a little bit of bad in every good little girl

One more lost and lonely  
Is it really what you need,

"From the very first moment I saw you, I knew our love would be so strong  
And the very first moment I kissed you, I knew our joy would last so long  
And then I saw you making love to my best friend, I didn't know whatever to
say  
I saw you making love to my best friend  
So I looked him right in his eyes and I said - listen boy  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Won't you take some more, it's what you came for  
And don't mind me, I won't throw you no curves  
Have yourself a ball with my good woman  
Won't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve  
Won't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve  
  
When I saw you hanging round the truck stop, shining like an angel in the
night  
And when I saw you crying like a baby, I knew you'd have to be my wife  
  
Then I saw you making love to my best friend, I didn't know whatever to say  
I saw you making love to my best friend  
So I looked him right in his eyes and I said - listen boy  
  
Now I think I'm gonna have to leave you  
Because I'm feeling much too weak to share  
And the pie, oh it's cut in too many pieces  
The flavor that I crave is no longer there  
  
Then I saw you making love to two of my best friends  
I didn't know whatever to say  
I saw you making love to a group of my best friends  
So I looked them right in their eyes and I said - listen here, group  
  
Won't you take some more boys, it's more than you deserve

"The entire city is burning  
You can see the flames like the inside of a mad jukebox  
Lost boys stalk the streets with those jungle markings on their chests  
Barbarians prowl in shadows their heads rocking with rodents  
Motorcycles reproduce in nocturnal alleys  
Groaning with greasy pleasure  
And they've blown up the YWCA like a giant balloon  
And sent it out to sea full of screaming, lovely, lonely girls

"Not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
I can still see you standing there.  
Midnight wind blowin' through your hair.  
Kisses sweet in the salty air.  
When love was forever.  
Turn the page and we fade to blue.  
The scene has changed now I'm without you.  
Walked away when the act was through.  
And the dream was over.  
It was almost like a movie  
The way you said goodbye.  
You must have a lot of time rehearsing each and every line.  
Now there's not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
Not a smile left on my face.  
The ending's just too sad to take.  
And there's not a dry eye.  
Not a dry eye in the house.  
The greatest story was you and me.  
Had it all we had everything, but now the.  
Story's done it's just history.  
The last act is over.  
You every line had the sweetest sound.  
Your every touch turned my world around.  
But the light came up and my world crashed down.  
End of show  
It's over.  
It was almost like a movie.  
Those nights we touched the stars.  
Time stood still for you and I.  
Now it's sad enough to make you cry.  
Now there's not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
Not a smile left on my face.  
The ending's just too sad to take.  
And there's not a dry eye.  
Not a dry eye in the house.  
Act one  
The story's just begun.  
Act two  
I fell in love with you.  
Act three  
Knew it was meant to be.  
Act four  
You don't love me no more.  
And there's not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
Not a smile left on my face.  
The ending's just too sad to take.  
And there's not a dry eye.  
Not a dry eye.  
Not a dry eye in the house.

"It's getting cold, it's getting dark, the nights are longer every day  
The air is heavy and the clouds will never burn away  
And we've been waitin' here so long that we've forgotten what it's like  
To turn into the fire, lookin' straight into the, straight into the light  
  
Your heart is tryin' to rock but it can barely beat at all  
Your soul is tryin' to run but all your body does is crawl  
You don't need any signal, you don't need any sign  
Nothin's gonna stop you once you cross over the line  
  
I want to tear it all apart and take the clothes right off your back  
We're tearin' down the highway and we're breakin' away, breakin' away  
Breakin' away, we're breakin' away from the pack  
We're breakin' away from the pack  
  
And if you don't have anywhere to go  
You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll  
And even if you don't have anywhere to go  
You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll  
And your speed is all you'll ever need, all you'll ever need to know  
  
[Chorus]  
You and me we're goin' nowhere slowly and we gotta get away from the past  
There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere baby  
But we should be goin' nowhere fast  
Everybody's goin' nowhere slowly  
They're only fighting for the chance to be last  
There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere baby  
But we should be goin' nowhere fast  
  
It's so much better goin' nowhere fast  
  
You shouldn't always see your world so clearly  
You shouldn't always know your place so well  
And all we're doin' here is hangin' around  
And goin' anywhere has gotta be heaven, 'cause stayin here is gonna be hell  
And goin' anywhere has gotta be heaven, 'cause stayin here has gotta be hell  
  
I'm getting lost, I'm getting found, I'm getting born again each day  
We're dyin' on the vine until we finally, 'til we finally get away  
The boundaries of this town are closin' in just like a noose  
The future's gonna rust if we don't put it to some, put it to some use  
  
Your heart is tryin' to rock but it can barely beat at all  
Your soul is tryin' to run but all your body does is crawl  
You don't need any signal, you don't need any sign  
Nothin's gonna stop you once you cross over the line

And ooh you got a cool machine, so let's get it runnin'  
We'll break the silence of the night  
And you know they're gonna hear us comin'  
We always see them whisper, we know they're gonna talk  
They fantasize the mysteries 'bout the night and the dark

We never have to say goodbye  
Oh one more kiss, baby one more kiss,  
It brings a little luck to the night  
  
Artists got their easels, they're ready on the mark  
Gonna try and take the pictures  
Of the dust and the gold in the sparks  
And ooh you got a cool machine, baby let's get it runnin'  
You never looked so good before  
And you know your time it's finally comin'  
'Cause our home is the wind, you know we're gods of the mornin'  
Champions of the night, when the engines are rumblin'  
Our home is the wind, you know we're gods of the mornin'

Under my foot gonna hit it down,  
Take this stance before the crowd  
Sleepin' city urban fall,  
Summer's sadness time to answer the call  
Cool machine, get it runnin', ready to roll  
Soft hands around my neck,  
One more kiss then it's time to connect  
Leave this child, leave me all alone,  
This one's mine and I'm takin' it home  
Ready, ready, ready to roll - this one's mine and I'm takin' it home

Of the soft parade and the heroes where they lie

And you know your time it's finally comin'  
'Cause our home is the wind, you know we're gods of the mornin'

Read 'em and weep, for the lies we believed  
Running silent and deep, and all the things that can never be said

We're on the edge of forever and we're never gonna fail  
  
How hard, how hard, how hard do I gotta try (I want all of your love)  
Surf's up (I need it so bad), surf's up (I need it so bad)  
Surf's up and so am I (I gotta give you some love)

"Listen  
I was born on the other side  
Just always looking to you  
I made it over the great divide  
Now I'm coming for you  
  
Your forces lined up in battle  
Your soldiers and your machines  
The sun been blacked out by shadows  
The darkest hour now you've ever seen  
  
And I'm easy and I'm serious  
They try and tear me down  
You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
I rose up on the doctor's slab  
Like Lazarus from the pit  
And everyone wants to take a stab  
Decorate me with blood, graffiti and spit  
  
I've been held up on money  
I've been beaten out of spite  
You want a piece of me honey?  
Lose or win  
  
You know you've been in a fight  
And I'm easy and I'm serious  
They try and tear me down  
You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
On March 6th, 1836 the walls of the Alamo fell  
To the Mexican army. After a 12-day siege, the  
Troops of Santa Ana were victorious but too  
Exhausted to hold on and the Texans won the  
War. It's further from El Paso to Texarkana,  
Then from New York to Chicago. And when it  
Joined the Union, Texas was the biggest state.  
Yeah, everything from Texas is big, larger than  
Life and none bigger than little Marvin Aday. So  
Big his daddy called him Meat Loaf. He grew  
Into a big man, with a big voice. And he sings  
Big songs and has big hits. You can try and  
Tear him down.  
  
Now there ain't much difference  
Between a bridge and a wall  
Without me right in the middle baby  
You'll be nothing at all  
  
And I'm easy and I'm serious  
They try and tear me down  
You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
And I'm easy and I'm serious  
They try and tear me down  
You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
Try and tear me down

"Come a little closer it's a feeling that I can't deny  
I was weak, but I never thought I'd speak about the darker site  
Is that a tent? I could repent upon the side of the road  
But, I kept on going yeah I headed for another load  
I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning  
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening  
Up from the ground in the middle of the night  
Oh, I testify  
  
I was laid upon the grave by a preacher's hand I cannot lie  
And, I forsake the many vows I made to be with you tonight  
Could you be the salvation cause I never felt like this before  
And, could you lend me your hand because I'm falling back on the floor

Up from the ground in the middle of the evening  
Up from the ground in the middle of the night

On a road outside of nowhere, in the middle of the night  
Well I guess I hit rock bottom and the dawn was not in sight  
And a Tempest made of fire, onset the sky aglow  
And a sweet young thing called out my name  
And this is how it goes, she says...  
""Go boy, can you hear them?  
Are you falling through the cracks in your eyes?""

Up from the ground in the middle of the evening  
Up from the ground and I'm falling back down  
Up from the ground and I testify  
  
Every cut that heals reveals a scar that you can never hope to hide  
All the pain that you restrain keeps building up deep inside  
If you think you're above it then it's you my friend that I implore  
You've got to walk before you run  
See the night before dawn  
Before you pull yourself off the floor  
  
I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning  
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening  
Up from the ground in the middle of the night

"I've been living my life in a cage  
Freedom spits in my face  
It was such a disgrace  
And I was lonely  
And feeling empty  
Desperate  
  
I had my head in a noose  
I had nothing to loose  
Had enough of abuse  
And now I'm dangerous  
Hateful, contagious  
It haunts us

I'm raging (I'm raging)

Tell me can you feel it  
As you hit the wall  
The monsters loose  
And now you have to choose  
And prove you can take it  
To the top before you fall  
  
I've walked a slippery road  
Felt a twitch in my soul  
Through the wind and the cold  
With no protection  
Just one direction  
Destruction  
  
I've paid for all my mistakes  
Taking all I can take  
Until I'm ready to break  
I'm feeling vicious  
And so outrageous  
It breaks us  
  
I'm leaving  
Still breathing  
I'm tearing through these chains

I've lived a thousand years in darkness  
Banished all alone  
Inside my mind with just my madness  
Behind these walls of stone  
  
I was falling apart at the seams  
Holding my breath just to breathe  
I tasted the sting of my tears  
  
I was waking up stuck in a dream  
Ran out of air, couldn't screamed  
Wasted away by my fears  
  
The monster's loose  
And now you know the truth  
Tell me can you feel it  
As you hit the wall  
  
The monster's loose  
And now you have to choose  
And prove that you can take it  
To the top and never fall  
  
The monster's loose  
You've lost your last excuse  
Now show me that you got it  
Even when you fall  
  
The monster's loose  
This game is win or loose  
Sometimes you gotta' do it  
And show the world you want it all

"I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia, California on my mind  
I straddled that greyhound and rode him into Raleigh, and on across Caroline  
I had motor trouble that turned into a struggle, halfway across Alabama  
And that 'Hound broke down and left me all stranded in Downtown Birmingham  
  
Right away I bought me a through train ticket, ridin' across Mississippi clean  
And I was on the Midnight Flyer out of Birmingham, smokin' into New Orleans  
  
Somebody helped me get out of Louisiana, just to help me get to Houston Town  
There are people there who care a little 'bout me  
And they won't let a poor boy down  
  
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit, they put luggage in my hand  
And I woke up high over Albuquerque on a jet to the Promised Land  
  
Workin' on a T-bone steak, I had a party flyin' over to the Golden State  
When the pilot told me in thirteen minutes  
He would get us at the Terminal zone  
  
Swing low, chariot, come down easy, taxi to the Terminal zone  
Cut your engines and cool your wings, and let me make it to the telephone  
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia, Tidewater 41009  
And tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land callin'

"Baby we can talk all night  
But that ain't gettin us nowhere  
I told you everything I possibly can  
There's nothing left inside of here  
And maybe you can cry all night  
But that'll never change the way I feel  
The snow is really piling up outside  
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here  
I poured it on and I poured it out  
I tried to show you just how much I care  
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout  
But you've been cold to me so long  
I'm crying icicles instead of tears  
  
And all I can do is keep on telling you  
I want you, I need you

You'll never drill for oil on a city street

Of a Cracker Jack box  
  
I can't lie, I can't tell you that I'm something I'm not  
No matter how I try  
I'll never be able to give you something  
Something that I just haven't got

And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart  
She never loved me back  
Oh I know  
  
I remember how she left me on a stormy night  
She kissed me and got out of our bed  
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door  
She packed her bags and turned right away  
  
And she kept on telling me  
She kept on telling me  
She kept on telling me  
I want you, I need you

"Wasted Youth  
Wasted Youth  
I remember everything!  
I remember everything little thing, as if it happened yesterday  
I was barely seventeen, and I once killed a boy with a Fender Guitar  
I don't remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster  
But I do remember that it had a heart of chrome, and a voice like a horny
angel  
I don't remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster  
But I do remember that it wasn't at all easy  
  
It required the perfect combination of the right power chords  
And the precise angle from which to strike!  
  
The guitar bled for about a week afterwords  
And the blood was zoot, dark and rich, like wild berry's  
The blood of the guitar was Chuck Berry red  
The guitar bled for about a week afterwords  
But it rung out beautifully  
And I was able to play notes that I had never even heard before  
  
So I took my guitar  
And I smashed it against the wall  
I smashed it against the floor  
I smashed it against the body of a varsity cheerleader  
Smashed it against the hood of a car  
Smashed it against a 1981 Harley-Davidson  
The Harley howled in pain  
The guitar howled in heat  
  
And I ran up the stairs to my parents bedroom  
Mommy and Daddy were sleeping in the moonlight  
Slowly I opened the door  
Creeping in the shadows right up to the foot of their bed  
I raised the guitar high above my head  
And just as I was about to bring the guitar crashing down upon the center of
the bed  
My father woke up, screaming ""Stop!""  
""Wait a minute. Stop it boy. What do you think your doing?""  
""That's no way to treat an expensive musical instrument""  
And I said, ""God Damn It daddy,""  
""You know I love you, But you've got a hell of a lot to learn about Rock n'
Roll""

There's a hole in the sky tonight  
Did the moon drift too far from sight?  
I would search through this empty darkness  
To see your face in the morning light  
  
We've been lost in a sea of confusion  
Got caught up in a selfish illusion  
But make no mistake: I will bend till I break  
Don't let fate make the choice for us

What about time to see it through?  
If you don't give you just don't get it  
What about me?  
What about you?

For a lifetime you'll feel there's a reason to believe  
In a love that's meant to be

It feels like we've fallen from grace  
Given up on the higher thing  
'Cause I know deep inside if we search we will find  
Something to give us wings

What about time to see it through?  
If you don't give you just don't get it?

Can't stand another night  
Of telling you I'm fine when I'm dying

To live without you  
Is reaching for something that never comes through  
Together is heaven  
Apart we're in hell  
The time for forgiveness is now  
  
Once in a lifetime you'll find  
Someone to share your dreams  
For a lifetime  
Our love will always set us free  
Forever we'll believe...

I can't forget the feelin of your sweat upon my skin  
And the tremble of your body on the day you let me in

On a summernight's surrender with nothing to loose  
You were scared and so was I when I gave myself to you  
It happens once, only once in a lifetime

What about time to see it through?  
If you don't give you just don't get it

What about love that won't say never?

If you don't live you just regret it

Your baby by your side, told the whole world you're comin'

A wolf at your door, you give it all, he wants more

Breathin' down your neck, boy  
It's sure hard to sleep  
  
With a wolf at your door  
  
They'll take it away, when you're not lookin'  
Look you in the eyes, tell you how good they're doin'  
Smiles on their faces, are lies to keep you from knowin'  
You're not guilty, you are the victim,  
But you still pay for the crime  
Don't look for trouble, it'll always find you in time
