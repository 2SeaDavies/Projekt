"All Along  
Deep inside secret's burning  
I Should have known all the while what's true  
I went along, to fool myself  
  
Can't go on, I can't escape it  
All along  
I think I really knew  
It was there in the words unspoken  
  
All along  
Still believed in you  
Now I stand here betrayed and broken  
Close my eyes from the burning  
  
All along all the while it's true  
Take it on, or turn your back  
Either way, you can't escape it

"Day after day your home life's a wreck  
The powers that be just  
Breathe down your neck  
You get no respect  
  
You get no relief  
You gotta speak up  
And yell out your piece  
So back off your rules  
  
Back off your jive  
'Cause I'm sick of not living  
To stay alive  
Leave me alone  
  
I'm not asking a lot  
I just don't want to be controlled  
That's all I want  
All I want  
  
How many times is it gonna take  
'Til someone around you hears what you say  
You've tried being cool  
You feel like a lie  
  
You've played by their rules  
Now it's their turn to try  
So back off your rules  
Back off your jive  
  
'Cause I'm sick of not living  
To stay alive  
Leave me alone  
I'm not asking a lot  
  
I just don't want to be controlled  
That's all I want

"Sometimes I think I'm gonna drown  
'Cause everyone around's so hollow

They follow  
And I'm alone  
Yeah if I make it I'd be amazed  
  
Just to find tomorrow  
One more day and I'd be amazed  
Just to see it waiting  
And if I make it I'm still alone  
  
No more hope for better days  
But if I could change  
Then I'd really be amazed  
And when you know you can't relate  
  
To one more shiny face  
Your heart breaks  
No one cares  
And when you know you can't go on  
  
'Cause everything is wrong  
Your heart breaks  
But no one's there

"In this world of hate and shallowness  
Where enemies become your consolation  
And those of us who win the game give up their minds  
I don't call that winning  
  
Say this doesn't apply to you  
But ask yourself first  
What have I done today to win the game  
And just what have I sacrificed  
  
Win the battle or lose the war  
I know I've played this game before  
When people were still real  
I don't want this anymore  
It's time for me to close the door  
There's nothing left to feel  
  
Reflect on all our yesterdays  
My own words choke me  
Why were they spoken  
Regret for the things I've said and done  
Just can't compare with  
  
Regret for those that I have never tried  
So blame this world or blame yourself  
It's really all the same  
When you are standing on the precipice  
From which you just can't return  
  
Win the battle or lose the war  
I know I've played this game before  
When people were still real  
I don't want this anymore  
It's time for me to close the door  
There's nothing left to feel  
  
In the style of forgotten men  
I look to my horizon  
I see nothing  
While thoughts of guns and desecration  
  
Sweep through my mind  
But only coffins and bones remain  
As I look to you  
The emptiness behind your eyes  
  
Seals my decision  
Can't carry on in this world of jugglers  
Where all this thoughtlessness and bludgeoning  
Your key to success  
What kind of tradition to carry on  
  
Blackball! The new disease  
Blackball! The new disease  
Blackball! Your evil ways  
Have found their way inside me  
  
Blackball! The new disease  
Blackball! The new disease  
Blackball! For a better life  
In this high tech dog eat dog existence

Someday I'm gonna change my mind

The fight back to like a wrecking crew  
Closing in on you, closing in on you  
And know it all oh oh

"I saw a little kid  
As he walked around  
He picked a candy bar up  
Off the ground  
  
He chowed about a half  
Then his face turned blue  
Turned out that candy bar was doggy-doo  
Don't pick it up I say  
  
Unless you can throw it away  
Don't pick it up I say  
You're gonna be bummed that you went that way  
  
You're out there makin' bacon  
No scrutiny  
You mess around too much  
And you got VD  
  
You know you never think  
And you're sore today  
You're gonna take it back to California  
Don't pick it up I say  
  
Unless you can throw it away  
Don't pick it up I say  
You're gonna be bummed that you went that way  
  
My friend was kinda hurtin'  
For a girl to try  
He saw one that looked like Pat  
On Saturday Night Live  
  
It had a pair of thingies  
But a mustache too  
Not clearly male nor female  
So now what to do  
  
Don't pick it up I say  
Unless you can throw it away  
Don't pick it up I say  
You're gonna be bummed that you went that way

"When we younger  
There always seemed like  
Some perfect mold  
That we're supposed to be  
But now we're growing up and  
I see it's just not that way  
Now I feel like someones lied to me  
  
Cause I've been true  
Made good for you  
And now I feel used  
I'm asking you  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
To be like you  
  
Tell me now elders  
What were your reasons for  
Making it seem  
Like you were so much more  
If you want to feel good  
Because of our accomplishments  
Why the fuck  
Don't you just do it yourself  
  
Cause I've tried  
Man I've tried  
While you all lied  
So now just tell me  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
To be like you  
  
Look at all the families now  
Who don't talk and don't trust  
Because of the way  
That things have been done  
When will you finally learn  
To leave out the bullshit  
And just be straight with us

"She wakes up  
Rage and grace  
Pulling me closer, pushing away  
And me  
The sharpest thorn on your vine  
Twisting and turning  
We're all intertwined  
  
Broken wing  
Empty glass  
Words that scream and bounce right back  
She says, you know  
We'd all like to rearrange  
  
I wish I could fix you  
And make you how I want you  
I wish I could fix you  
And I wish you could fix me  
  
I wish I could heal you  
And mend where you are broken  
I wish I could heal you  
And I wish you could heal me

A beaming sunrise buries the night  
The setting sun destroys the light  
The she says, baby  
I've gotta get going  
Cutting each other  
Without even knowing  
  
She sees a million stars  
Like holes in the sky  
All God's tears for her they cry  
And I am in her rain

You just gotta give what you can  
But I know for what I want it don't come easy as that

Tomorrow comes and things will look better by then.""  
But I'll look out the window  
Then look in the mirror at the same old me again

Still can't get it right  
And for all I know  
I swear I never will  
  
Do you think you'd sell your soul  
To just have one thing to turn out right?  
For the thousandth time you turn and find  
That it just makes no difference to try  
  
Like Holden Caulfield, I tell myself  
There's got to be a better way  
Then I lay in bed and stare at the ceiling  
Dream of brighter days

No way out  
Same old stuff always drags me down  
No way out  
Never gonna get it

Off of a cliff now  
I can still hear my mama yelling No No No  
But the words mean nothing  
  
Can't catch up to me now  
And the view is so beautiful  
All the way down  
When I was a little boy  
  
Suckin' juice from a bottle  
Believing my perceptions were oh so real  
But I don't know nothing  
Still knowing nothing  
  
Was just enough for me to know the way I feel  
This is life  
What a fucked up thing we do  
What a nightmare come true  
  
Or a playground if we choose  
And I choose  
  
Look at me I'm swollen  
Like a banana fish now  
I'm never gonna make it out of my hole  
But I keep on laughing  
  
Doesn't really matter  
There's dozens of reasons for explaining my soul  
When I was a teenager  
Suckin' booze with the Vatos  
  
Discussing who was gonna live to be 21  
They said they wouldn't make it  
They didn't make it  
We're all naked when the day is said and done  
  
This is life  
What a fucked up thing we do  
What a nightmare come true  
Or a playground if we choose  
And I choose  
  
Don't know who made this all come true

You just gotta do what you gotta do  
Now if I wasn't such a weenie

Pretending I'm an airplane on the living  
Room floor  
But like a lovely generator  
  
You stand right by me  
And if words were wisdom I'd be talking  
Even more  
So I keep on falling  
  
As I'm looking back above me  
Watching as my mama just becomes a little dot  
Now I'm like DeNiro  
I'm amarillo

So I thought  
Well so it seemed

But a mask was all there was  
So who wears the masks and who wears the faces

Now we might know each other just too well  
Cause when we're together we just can't get enough

Dreams quickly turn to reality  
Who's at fault in this game of yours and mine  
Well I guess I'll never know

Think of the girl who came softly inside me  
The look in her eyes, the smell of her hair  
Call her my own but is she really there?

Such noble words for noble minds  
Show me a love for life

Once I found a love I had to know

Back and forth the leaders sway  
Backing it up with guns

Hold the world on puppet strings  
Egos will feed  
While citizens bleed  
  
That's always the way it goes  
When will the world listen to reason  
I've got a feeling it'll be a long time  
When will the truth come in to season  
  
I've got a feeling it'll be a long time  
All they want is what they can defend  
Before their time is up  
Make the same mistakes again

Hold the world on puppet strings  
Egos will feed  
  
While citizens bleed  
That's always the way it goes  
Well if they tried  
Maybe they'd see  
  
It'd do a little good to let the world be free  
Handshake and a smile  
Gets you on through  
Then turn it all around with a suicide move  
  
But you know it's not fooling anyone but me  
You gotta make yourself see what you want to see

Say it happens all the time  
And it's said and done  
And Little Miss 1565 Your soul remains unclaimed

Morality won't help her  
When she lies silent in a morgue  
And all our sorrows just don't count at all

"This time you're really dead  
Once followed, but always led  
You thought you'd rise above it all  
  
It's all inside your head  
All ripping it up in shreds  
I know someday you're gonna fall  
  
And I don't wanna say I told you so  
But I told you so  
Now you've lost control  
  
And I don't wanna be the rise and fall  
So gimme more or nothing at all

Sucked in by what you crave  
They just can't wait to see you crawl  
  
And you can only laugh  
Give in to the other half  
They're only tearing down your walls  
  
They've come to see you rise and fall  
They're only tearing down your walls  
They've come to see you rise and fall  
And I don't wanna say you've lost control  
  
Rise and fall is  
Good and evil,  
Appearance and reality,  
Judgment and reflection.  
It is to judge and to be judged,  
To dream and to accept.  
It is Triumph and despair,  
Wish and realization,  
  
And we are both.

The cycle breaks me  
Am I ever gonna see the light?

Have never been enough just to make me stop

Takes me nowhere Oh no, here we go again

A familiar dream  
Of you telling me what I already know  
Though the truth seems near  
You can't get there from here  
But you sure know where you're gonna go  
  
As the rumor wind blows  
My infamy grows  
Seeing friends above  
And I hit another low  
The picture I paint to look at myself  
Is turning into somebody else  
  
I know how this will end  
But I'm starting up again  
Turned around, inside out

And stop digging my own grave  
I will try, to set things right  
Cause this way

Just stay alive for me

Is without me

And think of brighter days

That still lives on after life it takes  
In that one day, that changed our lives  
And bitter memories are left behind

friends try to make me stay, or call me a cab home,  
I grab my keys and a beer  
  
Cops they took my license away,  
got my car out of impound today  
I've been drunk since last Saturday,  
better stay out of my way  
  
I drink and drive  
Feel so alive  
Never take that dive  
Feel so alive  
Doing 95  
I drink and drive  
Feel so alive  
I drink and drive  
  
Early in the morning and the freeway's deserted, like its all mine  
I'm trying to set a new drunken speed record,  
but I can't drive a straight line  
Flashing lights, split the night  
I'm tossing bottles as I swerve to the right  
now I've slammed my face into the back of a big rig  
At least you'll never get me, you fucking pigs!  
Designate someone other than me,  
I'm so drunk I can hardly see  
Another shot of Jager and I turn the key,  
I got so many places to be  
  
When I'm on a binge, my friends all cringe  
They won't drive at night  
'Cause way down on the freeway it's such a fright  
But I think I drive alright

"Feelings  
Nothing more than feelings  
Trying to forget my  
Feelings of hate  
  
Imagine  
Beating on your face  
Trying to forget my  
Feelings of hate  
  
Feelings  
For all my life i'll feel it  
I wish I'd never met you  
You'll make me sick again  
  
Feelings, oh oh feelings  
Of hate on my mind  
  
Feelings  
Feelings like I never liked you  
Feelings like I want to kill you  
Live in my heart  
  
Feelings  
Feelings like I want to deck you  
Feelings like I've gotta get you  
Out of my life  
  
Feelings, oh oh feelings  
The hate's in my eyes  
  
Feelings, oh oh feelings  
You're not very nice

"Look at me while I look at you  
Seeing eye to eye we can never do  
You try to tell me what is right  
I may not know a lot but I know one thing  
  
[Chorus]  
If you've got the answer  
Then I don't want to know  
If you've got the answer  
Just keep it your own  
  
I wonder why our world is ablaze  
Sometimes I speak aloud to hear what people have to say  
I try to have an open mind  
But your brain and mouth must not be connected  
  
If you've got the answer  
Then I don't want to know  
If you've got the answer  
Just leave me alone  
  
I would be patient but it takes so long  
I don't want all this misinformation  
All the words that you say  
Lean on me while I lean on you  
If we destroy each other  
We might save a life or two  
A little sun, a little shine  
Separates us both by forever and a day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you've got a vision  
Then I don't want to see  
If you've got a notion  
Don't waste it on me

"Our lives run different ways  
Through the rain I see you in the sun  
Our star shines anyway  
If you wish upon it we are one  
  
Dog eat dog  
To get by  
Hope you like my genocide  
I find it such a shame  
  
Through the pain I see things as they are  
We're served up on a plate  
The pedestal is high enough to fall  
And if in time  
We can see the errors of our ways  
  
Would anyone change it anyhow  
Our time is up  
I bet you'd only run  
If you saw what goes inside our own  
  
I bet you'd lead the way  
If it were up to you to decide  
But it's not

"
"I'm getting edgy all the time  
There's someone around me just a step behind  
It's kinda scary, the shape I'm in  
The walls are shakin' and they're closing in  
  
Too fast or a bit too slow  
I'm paranoid of people and it's starting to show  
There's one guy that I can't shake  
Over my shoulder is a big mistake  
  
Sitting on the bed  
Or lying wide awake  
There's demons in my head  
And it's more than I can take  
  
[Chorus]  
I think I'm on a roll  
But I think it's kinda weak  
Saying all I know is  
I gotta get away from me  
  
I tell you something just ain't right  
My head is on loose but my shoes are tight  
Avoiding my friends cause they all bug  
Life is a riddle and I'm really stumped  
  
If you reason, don't you know  
Your own preoccupation is where you'll go  
I think I'm being followed, I look around  
It's only my shadow creepin' on the ground  
  
[Chorus]

"
"One is for envy and one just for spite  
The cuts in my heart, they show me your eyes  
Don't make it better by twisting knife,  
Turns all by itself, on to someone else  
  
Your self-liberation, we'll leave this behind,  
Beyond slings and arrows that rain on our minds  
You'll make it better shaking it off  
It never mattered anyway  
  
[Chorus]  
If we don't make it alive, it's a hell of a good day to die  
All our light that shines strong only lasts for so long  
And it's ashes to ashes again, should we even try to pretend?  
All our light that shines strong only lasts for so long  
  
The banner you're waving is burning and red  
It's blocking the sun light that shines overhead  
You against the world, diamonds and pearls,  
Voices inside you churn, watch the city burn  
  
Your own liberation will leave them behind  
All the slings and arrows that rain on your mind,  
Don't make it better break it 'cause  
It never mattered anyway  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I won't calm down  
  
The banner you're waving is burning and red,  
You against the world, diamonds and pearls  
It never mattered, mattered,  
Mattered anyway!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All our light that shines strong only lasts for so long!

Shadow of death , I will fear no evil:

And you can cry 'teacher come help me!'  
Through you all

Like someone else was keeping score  
And what could make you whole was simply out of reach

"On a mission started by my own admission  
I will leave you all behind  
By direction I'll create my own protection

Aspirations turn to fear and desperation  
Nothing's ever good enough for you  
Burn in sorrow 'cause I see there's no tomorrow  
You'll only see what I want you to  
  
Never gonna find me  
Never gonna find me  
Way down deep inside there is a real me  
I'm always gonna hide and this is who you'll see  
Never gonna find me  
Never gonna find me  
Way down deep inside they haven't found me yet  
I'm always gonna hide and this is who you'll get  
  
On a mission to establish my attrition  
You may think that you have won  
Your rejection has brought on my introspection  
I'll escape I'll only run  
  
Accusations may destroy my motivation  
I can feel it when you're pushing me  
Burn in sorrow 'cause I see there's no tomorrow  
Only I know which me you'll see  
  
Break away!  
Run!  
Down inside!  
I've got to!  
Push it way!  
Down!  
I did not choose this!  
  
I don't really know  
What I want to say  
I can't afford the throw  
Can't make it go away  
Try to make it through  
Fuck your decision  
I can't feel myself  
But I'm burning up now!  
  
Never gonna find me

"Our generations  
Sees the world not the same as before  
We might as well just throw it all  
And live like there's no tomorrow  
There's no tomorrow  
  
We are the ones  
Who are living under the gun everyday  
You might be gone before you know  
So live like there's no tomorrow-ain't gonna waste this life  
There's no tomorrow-you ain't gonna live it for me  
  
Believe it  
The official view of the world has changed  
In a whole new way  
Live fast cause if you don't take it  
You'll never make it  
  
So if you understand me  
And if you feel the same  
Then you will know what nitro means  
You'll live like there's no tomorrow-ain't gonna waste this life  
There's no tomorrow-you ain't gonna live it for me  
There's no tomorrow

Always waiting for a  
Waiting for a warning  
  
Burned at the stake  
Inside I'm blistering  
Not a whisper  
Looking in you'd never know it  
Miles below  
I look up again  
When you snap they say  
Before you never show it  
  
Someone said it's all right  
Save it now, don't say it for my sake  
Someone said it's all right  
Faster now, you know I got no brakes  
  
Fuses glow  
Wounds festering  
Till the wind comes up  
And takes it to the last pow  
Back and forth  
Staring at the wall  
This room's a cage  
I know that something's got to give now  
  
Someone said it's all right  
Save it now, don't say it for my sake  
Someone said it's all right  
Faster now, you know I got no brakes

"I'm not the one who made the world what it is today  
I'm not the one who caused the problems started long ago  
But now I deal with all the consequence that troubles our times  
I carry on and never once have even questioned why  
  
I'm innocent  
But the weight of the world is on my shoulders  
I'm innocent  
But the battles started are far from over  
  
We 're not the ones who leave the homeless in the streets at night  
We're not the ones who've kept minorities and women down  
Still we grow and then the problems they become our own  
We carry on without even realizing why  
  
We're innocent  
But the weight of the world is on our shoulders  
We're innocent  
But the battles left us are far from over  
  
We're not the ones whose pollution blackened our skies  
And ruined our streams  
We're not the ones who made the nuclear bombs  
That threaten our lives  
  
We're not the ones who let the children starve in faraway lands  
We're not the ones who made the streets unsafe to walk at night  
And even if we try and not become so overwhelmed  
And if we make some contribution to the plight we see  
  
Still our descendants will inherit our mistakes of today  
They'll suffer just the same as we and never wonder why

Shattered glass will cure my ills and make me feel alright

Gonna break it  
And never stop running  
Making nothing from something  
Making nothing from something  
  
Cut me for the lion's share  
It's mindless but I don't care  
'Cause no matter what I say  
I'm in a another fight  
  
Take more shit, I've had enough  
Tonight I'm gonna rip it up  
Broken windows cure my ills and make me feel alright

About how long it was taking  
Or how the walls they were shaking  
  
Now lying in bed, wallowing in sorrow  
Missing the tomorrow that we could have had  
Running through my head, over and over  
Things I never told her now just make me sad  
  
And it drives me insane  
Sitting with the vision  
Stuck with that image burned into my brain  
And I feel so dumb  
That I could ever trust her  
While someone else fucked her  
Then walked away

"Hey now do you see me down the way  
Been watching you everyday  
In my car on your street is where I stay  
I know you better that way  
One day I'll be meeting you for real  
You'll feel bad like I feel  
  
It'll blow you away - you're gonna fall for me [Repeat: x 2]  
And the voices told me  
To blow you away - you're gonna fall for me [Repeat: x 2]  
  
Hey now well I'm kncking on your door  
This special delivery is yours  
My infatuation it's true  
Hello, I got something for you  
  
It'll blow you away - you're gonna fall for me [Repeat: x 2]  
And the voices told me  
To blow you away - you're gonna fall for me [Repeat: x 2]  
  
If you hadn't sold me  
I'd still be away - you're right in front of me [Repeat: x 2]  
Then, I'll be on my way  
Breathing you okay  
  
Can't break from my sins  
Cannot pray [Repeat: x 2]  
  
But you can't kill a man when he's got no hope  
You can't kill a man when he's got no hope  
You can't kill a man when he's got no hope  
You can't kill a man when he's...OH GOD, HELP ME!  
  
It'll blow you away - you're gonna fall for me [Repeat: x 2]  
And the voices told me  
To blow you away - you're gonna fall for me [Repeat: x 2]  
  
If you hadn't sold me  
I'd still be away - you're right in front of me [Repeat: x 2]

"Maybe life is like a ride on a freeway  
Dodging bullets while you're trying to find your way  
Everyone's around, but no one does a damn thing  
It brings me down, but I won't let them  
  
If I seem bleak  
Well you'd be correct  
And if I don't speak  
It's cause I can't disconnect  
But I won't be burned by the reflection  
Of the fire in your eyes  
As you're staring at the sun  
  
When I ran I didn't feel like a runaway  
When I escaped I didn't feel like I got away  
There's more to living than only surviving  
Maybe I'm not there, but I'm still trying  
  
Though you hear me  
I don't think that you relate  
My will is something  
That you can't confiscate  
So forgive me, but I won't be frustrated  
By destruction in your eyes  
As you're staring at the sun

"When you won't go along  
Some will feel like you can't find your way  
Heaven knows  
Heaven knows I've seen it all before  
Now don't get me wrong  
I've seen many a life gone astray  
When someone goes  
All your bows won't make it any better so let it go  
  
[Chorus]  
Shut up and take it like a man  
You need us to get a life  
For your own good we'll take you by the hand  
'Cause you need a little more  
  
Maybe no one will say it  
Maybe no one's aware it goes on  
All I know  
All I know it's like going off the deep end  
Could you make a decision?  
Could you think for yourself and go on?  
Everyone knows  
Everyone knows you've got to fit into the mainstream so save your woes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Close your eyes  
Look away now  
Make believe while you can  
So you'd best go along  
Don't let on if you can't find your way  
Many more  
Many more do it for you  
Because heaven knows  
Heaven knows it's like playing with fire  
Your life's a throw

If the man that's in your sights  
Ever kissed his girl goodbye

And tomorrow glass will grow  
On the freedoms that divide us  
They're coming after me  
Flashback nineteen eighty-four  
Now who's knock-knocking at your door?  
A thought that starts a riot  
They're coming after me now  
  
Life is not the same  
I am one but  
Sparks turn into flames  
  
Will you take what's in my head?  
And erase me when I'm dead?  
'Cause the future is now  
Now I'm disappearing  
  
The day has turned to night  
Can you save me from the light?  
'Cause the future is here  
This is how I disappear  
  
Running down a spiral  
With the light of better men  
Shouting progress is survival  
Take one last look and see me  
Now you see me, now you don't  
No vow to break  
No string of hope  
My hero, your pariah  
They're coming after me now  
  
Life is just God's game  
I am one but  
Sparks turn into flames  
  
And you get what you deserve  
When revenge is what you serve  
'Cause the future is now  
Now I'm disappearing  
  
I'll sink into the night  
And I'm turning off the lights  
'Cause the future is here  
This is how I disappear  
  
So the end's what you make it  
And that's what you're looking for  
This is the future  
The future is now  
  
Disappear, disappear  
Disappear, disappear  
  
Now turn off the lights  
The skies are blue inside you  
Turn off the lights  
They'll get inside of you  
  
Will you take what's in my head?  
And erase me when I'm dead?  
'Cause the future is now  
Now I'm disappearing  
  
The day has turned to night

"When we were young the future was so bright  
The old neighborhood was so alive  
And every kid on the whole damn street  
Was gonna make it big and not be beat  
  
Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn  
The kids are grown up but their lives are worn  
How can one little street  
Swallow so many lives  
  
Chances thrown  
Nothing's free  
Longing for what used to be  
Still it's hard  
Hard to see  
Fragile lives, shattered dreams  
  
Jamie had a chance, well she really did  
Instead she dropped out and had a couple of kids  
Mark still lives at home cause he's got no job  
He just plays guitar and smokes a lot of pot  
  
Jay committed suicide  
Brandon OD'd and died  
What the hell is going on  
The cruelest dream, reality

I gotta go make my own mistakes  
  
Sorry man for feeling  
Feeling the way I do

Open wide and they'll shove in  
  
Their meaning of life

By the way

It may seem like the way to go  
Me, I'd rather be found  
Trying something new

There's no right and wrong way

We all end up forsaken, we're just choosing our own way

And leaves us with emptiness of no more tries

The best of our intentions come crashing down in flames  
The depths of our despair we are unable to contain

Your bruises are reminders of naivete and trust  
You're only feeling stronger cause your body's getting numb

Put the coins in your eyes

I walk right through the nameless ones.  
I know that hope's unknown.  
Sometimes the water feels so real.  
As I walk through it fills my lungs, my god, I'm drowning.  
This day never seems  
This pain, never.  
This day never seems to end  
This rage I can not let go.  
  
I hear them calling.  
I feel them gnawing out holes through flawless souls.  
  
So alone. Sometimes I swear that I can hear the taunting of the voiceless
ones.  
I fear that I alone fear those ceased to feel they're alone inside of this
place.  
I am the misplaced.  
This day never seems  
This pain, never.

Now everyone, do you know, I know your deception.
