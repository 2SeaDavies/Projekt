"There goes the siren that warns of the air raid  
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak  
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne  
Got to get up for the coming attack.  
  
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines  
Remove all the wheelblocks there's no time to waste  
Gathering speed as we head down the runway  
Gotta get airborne before it's too late.  
  
Running, scrambling, flying  
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again.  
Running, scrambling, flying  
Rolling, turning, diving.  
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die  
Run, live to fly, fly to live. Aces high.  
  
Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers  
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away  
Roll over, spin round and come in behind them  
Move to their blindsides and firing again.  
  
Bandits at 8 O'clock move in behind us  
Ten ME-109's out of the sun  
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them  
Heading straight for them I press down my guns  
  
Rolling, turning, diving  
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again  
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die  
Run, live to fly, fly to live,  
Aces high.

"I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more  
I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart  
I can't be sympathizing with a new lost cause  
I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all  
  
And all the politicians and their hollow promises  
And all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it  
The working man pays everything for their mistakes  
And with his life too if there was to be a war  
  
[Chorus]  
So we can only get one chance, can we take it?  
And we only got one life, can't exchange it  
Can we hold on to what we have, don't replace it  
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream  
  
A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday  
The victims' mind are scarred for life most everyday  
Assailants know just how much further they can go  
They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can't protect yourselves even in your own home  
For fear of vigilante cries, the victims wipe their eyes  
So now the criminal they launch right in our face  
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace  
  
Despondent public worries, where it will all end?  
We can't protect ourselves, our kids from the crime trend  
We cannot even warn each other of evil in our midst  
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just

"'What the fuck is that?'  
'Hi, guys, are you in a band or something?  
I mean it would be so cool  
If you were in a band 'cause you're  
Driving a big bus with band on the front of it'  
'Why don't you shut up and get on board will ya?'  
'Wow! I have it here you got a stereo and a microwave  
And, and you got a beer,  
I'd like a Heineken if you've got one'  
That's real cool, that's great, yeah!'  
'Would you like to see Black Bart?'  
'Who's Black Bart?'  
'Let me introduce you'  
  
Black Bart's seen it  
Black Bart knows  
Black Bart's done it  
The Black Bart blues  
Suspended in suspension  
Medieval nights in Tennessee, and elsewhere  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
  
Black Bart's truckin' ain't what it seems  
Black Bart's lookin'  
Don't know where she's been  
Maybe she's an acrobat  
Spends her evenings dancing on a pole  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
  
Black Bart tried most anything  
Black Bart liked it but he couldn't sing  
So he asked me to tell ya  
Try it for yourself and you will see  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
  
'What did you do that for?'  
'I'm sorry, I just, I guess I'm not used to...  
'Shut up and get on with it will you'  
  
Black Bart's livin' across the ocean now  
Black Bart's lookin' to come back somehow  
So if you are a dancer,  
You could dance his pole in May  
That's a maypole  
  
Black Bart's coming  
Now Black Bart's gone  
Black Bart did it so I wrote this song  
Whatever and however,  
In and out or several at a time mmm yes!  
We all got to do the Black Bart blues  
Here comes the guitar solo  
  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
Yowsa! Yowsa! Yowsa!

"And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life  
What do you think you'd expect you would see?  
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life  
And in the river reflections of me  
  
Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see  
And in a movement he beckons to me  
And in a moment the memories are all that remain  
And all the wounds are reopening again  
  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
  
And as you look all around at the world in dismay  
What do you see, do you think we have learned  
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray  
Out in the streets where the babies are burned  
  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
  
There are time when I feel I'm afraid for the world  
There are times I'm ashamed of us all  
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel  
And reflecting the good and the bad  
  
Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?  
Can you really tell me what life is?  
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you  
Could be swept away by fate's own hand  
  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
  
When you think that we've used all our chances  
And the chance to make everything right  
Keep on making the same old mistakes  
Makes untipping the balance so easy  
When we're living our lives on the edge  
Say a prayer on the book of the dead  
  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

We kiss the earth goodbye

Coming home, far away  
As the vapor trails aline  
Where I've been tonight  
You know I will not stay  
  
Carving on the edge of daylight  
Till it slips into the void  
Waited in the long night dreaming  
Till the sun is born again  
  
Stretch the fingers of my hand  
Cover countries with my span  
Just a lonely satellite  
Speck of dust and cosmic sand  
  
Over borders that divide the  
Earthbound tribes  
Through the dark atlantic  
Over mariners stormy waves

If he had a rich man in his hand  
And who would steal the candy from a laughing baby's mouth  
If he could take it from the money man

She signs no contract but she always plays it clean  
She dines in Hampstead village, an expense accounted gruel  
And the jack knife barber drops her off at school  
Laughing in the playground gets no kicks from little boys  
Would rather make it with a letching gray  
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung  
Who watches through the railings as they play  
Cross-eyed Mary finds it hard to get along  
A poor man's rich girl and she'll do it for a song  
A rich man's stealer but her favour's good and strong  
She's the Robin Hood of Highgate, let the poor man get along

"Have you ever felt the future is the past, but you don't know how?  
A reflected dream of a captured time, is it really now, is it really
happening?  
  
Don't know why I feel this way, have I dreamt this time, this place?  
Something vivid comes again into my mind  
And I think I've seen your face, seen this room, been in this place  
Something vivid comes again into my mind  
  
All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation  
Have I found my destination? I just can't take no more  
  
The dream is true, the dream is true  
The dream is true, the dream is true  
  
Think I've heard your voice before, think I've said these words before  
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind  
Am I still inside my dream? Is this a new reality  
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind  
  
All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation  
Coming to the realization that I can't see for sure  
  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, please save me from myself

The dream is true, the dream is true  
  
I get up put on the light, dreading the oncoming night  
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again  
Nothing that I contemplate, nothing that I can compare  
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head  
  
Dread to think what might be stirring, that my dream is reoccurring  
Got to keep away from drifting, saving me from myself  
  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
  
Lost in a dream of mirrors, lost in a paradox  
Lost and time is spinning, lost a nightmare I retrace  
Lost a hell that I revisit, lost another time and place  
Lost a parallel existence, lost a nightmare I retrace  
  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself

"I am a man who walks alone  
And when I'm walking a dark road  
At night or strolling through the park  
  
When the light begins to fade  
I sometimes feel a little strange  
A little anxious when it's dark  
  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have constant fear that something's  
Always near  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have a phobia that someone's  
Always there

The wall  
And have you felt your neck skin crawl  
When you're searching for the light?  
Sometimes when you're scared  
To take a look  
At the corner of the room  
You've sensed that something's  
Watching you  
  
Have you ever been alone at night  
Thought you heard footsteps behind  
And turned around and no one's there?  
And as you quicken up your pace  
You find it hard to look again  
Because you're sure there's  
Someone there  
  
Watching horror films the night before  
Debating witches and folklore's  
The unknown troubles on your mind  
Maybe your mind is playing tricks  
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix  
On dancing shadows from behind  
  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have a constant fear that something's  
Always near  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have a phobia that someone's  
Always there

The smell of resigned leather  
The steely iron mask  
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call.

To fear no mortal man  
and now you'll wreak your vengeance in the  
Screams of evil men.

Somewhere there's someone dying  
In a foreign land  
Meanwhile the world is crying stupidity of man

So how can I face the torment alone  
The vivid scenes and all the recurring nightmares  
I lay there and sweat until it gets light  
  
People say 'don't worry'  
Say that time's a perfect healer  
That the nightmares they will come to pass  
Can't hear what they're saying  
I am living in my own world  
And I'm feeling trance-like all the time  
  
I hear voices in my head  
Could I really be going crazy  
In the night the visions seem so real  
Do you care if you live or die  
When you laugh are you really crying  
You're not sure what's real anymore  
  
Fortunes of war  
Fortunes of war  
Fortunes of war  
No pain anymore  
  
Sometimes I wake  
I feel that my spirit's broken  
I wonder if I've the strength  
Carry on carry on

"Shadows may hide you but also may be your grave  
You're running today maybe tomorrow you'll be saved  
You pray for daylight to save you for a while  
You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile  
  
Dead men, tell no tales  
Gangland, murder's up for sale  
Dead men, tell no tales  
Gangland, where jail birds die  
  
Face at the window leers into your own  
But it's only your reflection still you tremble in your bones  
How long can you hide? How long till they come?  
A rat in a trap but you've got to survive  
  
Once you were glad to be free for a while  
The air tasted good and the world was your friend  
Then came the day when the hard times began  
Now you're alone, but alive for how long?  
  
A knife at your throat another body on the pile  
A contract to keep and it's service with a smile  
Murder for vengeance or murder for gain  
Death on the streets or a blackened out jail  
  
Dead men, tell no tales  
In Gangland, murder's up for sale  
Dead men, tell no tales  
In Gangland, where jail birds die  
  
In Gangland you tell no tales

"Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul  
Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal  
Ships in the night when they pass out of sight  
Deliver their cargo of earthly delights  
  
To the women and children, the souls of the dead  
I've opened their book and no mercy is shed  
You want forgiveness and you want it cheap  
I don't give redemption rewards for the meek  
  
Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame  
There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself  
You can't blame a madman if you go insane  
Give me the strength so I carry on

Trapped in the web, but I cut the threads  
Show you the gates of tomorrow  
Trapped in the web, no mercy is shed  
Show you the gates of tomorrow  
Trapped in the web, slaves to the dead  
Show you the gates of tomorrow  
Trapped in the web, but I cut the threads  
Show you the gates of tomorrow  
  
Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame  
There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself

"I have sailed to many lands, now I make my final journey  
On the bow I stand, west is where I go  
Through the night I plough, still my heart, calculate and pray  
As the compass swings, my will is strong, I will not be led astray  
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun  
But I know, but I know, but I know  
  
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost  
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost  
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea  
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me  
  
Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves  
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son,  
Chasing rainbows all my days  
  
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been  
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so,  
Nothing's real until you feel  
  
I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name  
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain  
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind  
For eternity I follow on there is no other way  
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun  
But I know, I know  
  
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost  
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost  
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea  
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me  
  
Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves  
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son  
Chasing rainbows all my days

"I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime  
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time  
Cause at 5 o'clock, they take me to the Gallows Pole  
The sands of time for me are running low, yeah!  
  
When the priest comes to read me the last rites  
I take a look through the bars at the last sights  
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me  
  
Can it be that there's some sort of error  
Hard to stop the surmounting terror  
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?  
  
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming  
It's not easy to stop from screaming  
The words escape me when I try to speak  
Tears flow, but why am I crying  
After all I'm not afraid of dying  
Don't I believe that there never is an end  
  
As the guards march me out to the courtyard  
Somebody cries from a cell ""God be with you""  
If there's a God then why has he let me go?  
  
As I walk my life drifts before me  
Though the end is near I'm not sorry  
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away  
  
Mark my words, believe my soul lives on  
Don't worry now that I have gone  
I've gone beyond to seek the truth  
  
When you know that your time is close at hand  
Maybe then you'll begin to understand  
Life down here is just a strange illusion.

I lie asleep in the midst of a dream,  
Is it now could it be that the angel of death has come for me?  
I can't believe that really my time has come,  
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone,  
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away.

I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays,  
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed,  
At all of the people standing there in front of me,  
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led,  
Is this the place where the living join the dead?  
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare.

My body tingles, I feel so strange,  
I feel so tired, I feel so drained,  
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again,  
Is this in limbo or in Heaven or Hell?  
Maybe I'm going down there as well,  
I can't accept my soul will drift forever.  
I feel myself floating back down to Earth,  
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?  
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

"Infinite dreams I can't deny them  
Infinity is hard to comprehend  
I couldn't hear those screams  
Even in my wildest dreams  
  
Suffocation waking in a sweat  
Scared to fall asleep again  
Incase the dream begins again  
Someone chasing I cannot move  
Standing rigid nightmare's statue  
What a dream when will it end  
And will I transcend?  
  
Restless sleep the minds in turmoil  
One nightmare ends another fertile  
Getting to me so scared to sleep  
But scared to wake now, in too deep  
  
Even though its reached new heights  
I rather like the restless nights  
It makes me wonder it makes me think  
There's more to this I'm on the brink  
It's not the fear of what's beyond  
It's just that I might not respond  
I have an interest almost craving  
But would I like to get too far in?  
  
It can't be all coincidence  
Too many things are evident  
You tell me you're an unbeliever  
Spiritualist? well me I'm neither  
But wouldn't you like to know the truth  
Of what's out there to have the proof  
And find out just which side you're on  
Where would you end in Heaven or in Hell?  
  
Help me, help me to find my true  
Self without seeing the future  
Save me, save me from torturing  
Myself even within my dreams  
  
There's got to be  
More to it than this  
Or tell me why do we exist  
I'd like to think that when I die  
I'd get a chance another time  
And to return and live again  
Reincarnate, play the game  
Again and again and again and again

Off in the distance the lightning is flashing again  
Feel something strong as the power draws near

Is it the crashing of clouds that hold fear  
But all I know as I sit in a corner alone  
It takes me back to my childhood again  
  
And as I wait and I look for an answer  
To all the things going round in my head  
I ask myself could it be a disaster and when  
It's maybe threatening to happen again

There's a lone dog howls in the park  
All the people hurry inside  
As a lightning flash lights dark  
The storm is nearly here  
Only God will know  
  
You're sitting alone you watch  
As the wind is blowing treetops  
And the swaying rustling leaves  
Plenty of time to perceive  
As you wait for rain to fall  
Only God knows

Maybe lightning strikes twice  
Maybe lightning strikes twice

Free your soul and let it fly  
Mine was caught I couldn't try  
Time returns again to punish all of us  
  
We are cast out by our bloody father's hand  
We are strangers in this lonely promised land  
We are the shadows of the one unholy ghost  
In our nightmare world the only one we trust

"I don't care for this world anymore  
I just want to live my own fantasy  
Fate has brought us to these shores  
What was meant to be is now happening  
  
I've found that I like this living in danger  
Living on edge it makes feel as one  
Who cares now what's right or wrong,  
It's reality  
Killing so we survive  
Wherever we may roam  
Wherever we may hide  
We've got to get away  
  
I don't want existence to end  
We must prepare ourselves for the elements  
I just want to feel like we're strong  
We don't need a code of morality  
  
I like all the mixed emotion and anger  
It brings out the animal the power you can feel  
And feeling so high on this much adrenalin  
Excited but scary to believe what we've become  
  
Saints and sinners  
Something within us  
We are lord of flies  
  
Saints and sinners  
Something willing us  
To be lord of the flies

"The freeway is jammed  
And it's backed up for miles  
The car is an oven and baking is wild  
Nothing is ever the way it should be  
What we deserve we just don't get you see  
  
A briefcase, a lunch and a man on the edge  
Each step get closer to losing his head  
Is someone in heaven are they looking down  
Cause nothing is fair just you look around  
  
Falling down  
Falling down  
Falling down  
  
He's sick of waiting of lying like this  
There's a hole in the sky for the angels to kiss  
Branded a leper because you don't fit  
In the land of the free  
You can't live by your wits  
  
Once he built missiles a nation's defence  
Now he can't even give birthday presents  
Across the city he leaves in his wake  
A glimpse of the future a cannibal state

"At a point below zero  
There's no place left to go  
Six hundred unknown heroes  
Were killed like sleeping buffalo  
  
Through the devil's canyon  
Across the battlefield  
Death has no companion  
The spirit is forced to yield  
  
There goes the bandolero  
Through the hole in the wall  
He's a coward but doesn't care though  
In fact, he doesn't care at all  
  
The general that's commanding  
He's defending what he fears  
While the troops they are depending  
On reinforcements from the rear  
  
If God is in the heavens  
How can this happen here?  
In His name, they used the weapons  
For the massacre  
  
There is a point below zero  
Where the sun can see the land  
Six hundred unknown heroes  
Lay dead in the sand

"I stand alone in this desolate space  
In death they are truly alive  
Massacred innocence, evil took place  
The angels were burning inside  
  
Centuries later I wonder why  
What secret they took to their grave  
Still burning heretics under our skies  
Religion's still burning inside

Blood on the stones of the citadel  
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur

Blood on the stones of the citadel  
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur  
Blood on the stones of the citadel  
  
As we kill them all so God will know his own  
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne  
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal  
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross  
  
Templar believers with blood on their hands  
Joined in the chorus to kill on demand  
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty  
To stand with the catharsis, to die and be free  
  
The book of Old Testament crippled and black  
Satan - his weapon is lust  
Leaving this evil damnation of flesh  
Back to the torture of lies  
  
The perfect ones willingly died at the stake  
And all of their followers slain  
As for the knowledge of God they had claimed  
Religion's still burning inside

As we kill them all so God will know his own  
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne

Templar believers with blood on their hands  
Joined in the chorus to kill on command  
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty  
Still running herretics under our skies  
  
As we kill them all so God know his own  
Laugh at the darkness and in god we trust  
The eye in the triangle smiling with sin  
No passover feast for the cursed within  
  
Facing the sun as they went to their grave  
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave  
Death is the price for your soul's liberty  
To stand with the catharsis and to die and be free

Seven ways to win  
Seven holy paths to hell

Seven downward slopes  
Seven bloodied hopes

Seven your desires

The fallen angel watching you  
Babylon, the scarlet whore

Kill him now and save the young ones  
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe  
Be the devils own, Lucifer's my name

Moonchild open the seventh seal  
  
I count the heads of those unborn  
The accursed ones I'll find them all  
And if you die by your own hand  
As a suicide you shall be damned  
And if you try to save your soul  
I will torment you, you shall not grow old  
With every second and passing breath  
You'll be so alone your soul will bleed to death  
  
Moonchild hear the mandrake scream  
Moonchild open the seventh seal  
Moonchild you'll be mine soon child  
Moonchild take my hand tonight  
  
The twins they are exhausted, seven is this night  
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite  
Seven angels seven demons battle for his soul  
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die  
  
One more dies one more lives  
One baby cries one mother grieves  
For all the sins you will commit  
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give  
A web of fear shall be your coat  
To clothe you in the night  
A lucky escape for you young man  
But I'll see you damned in endless night  
  
Moonchild hear the mandrake scream  
Moonchild open the seventh seal  
Moonchild you'll be mine soon child  
Moonchild take my hand tonight

Middle winter cold winds blow  
From the trees the snowflakes drifting  
Swirling round like ghosts in the snow  
  
Mother Russia poetry majestic  
Tells the time of a great empire  
Turning round the old man ponders  
Reminiscing an age gone by

Dance of the czars  
Hold up your heads  
Be proud of what you are  
Now it has come  
Freedom at last  
Turning the tides of history  
And your past

Hold up your heads  
Remember who you are  
Can you release  
The anger the grief  
Can you be happy  
Now your people are free

Who saves me from hell?  
And who is my god?  
And where is my soul?

Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart

Playing god without mercy, without fear  
Create a beast, made a man without a soul

But I don't know how  
Recycled again a lifetime of pain  
The spawn of a man  
The devil has planned

Would I tell you truth  
Now there's something to bet on  
You've got nothing to lose  
  
When I've sat by the window  
And gazed at the rain  
With an ache in my heart  
But never feeling the pain  
And if you would tell me  
Just what my life means  
Walking a long road  
Never reaching the end  
  
God give me the answer to my life  
God give me the answer to my dreams  
God give me the answer to my prayers  
God give me the answer to my being

Some innocent pawn in an end game one more stalemate  
Is death another birthday?  
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?  
Do the undead live within us  
And look through our eyes?  
  
Walking on water are miracles all you can trust  
Measure your coffin does it measure up to your lust?  
So I think I'll leave you  
With your bishops and your guilt  
So until the next time  
Have a good sin

"In a foreign field he lay  
Lonely soldier, unknown grave  
On his dying words he prays  
Tell the world of Paschendale  
  
Relive all that he's been through  
Last communion of his soul  
Rust your bullets with his tears  
Let me tell you 'bout his years  
  
Laying low in a blood filled trench  
Kill Tim 'til my very own death  
On my face I can feel the falling rain  
Never see my friends again  
  
In the smoke, in the mud and lead  
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread  
Soon be time to go over the wall  
Rapid fire and the end of us all  
  
Whistles, shouts and more gun fire  
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire  
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb  
Be reunited with my dead friends soon  
  
Many soldiers eighteen years  
Drown in mud, no more tears  
Surely a war no-one can win  
Killing time about to begin  
  
Home, far away  
From the war, a chance to live again  
Home, far away  
But the war, no chance to live again  
  
The bodies of ours and our foes  
The sea of death it overflows  
In no man's land, God only knows  
Into jaws of death we go  
  
Crucified as if on a cross  
Allied troops they mourn their loss  
German war propaganda machine  
Such before has never been seen  
  
Swear I heard the angels cry  
Pray to god no more may die  
So that people know the truth  
Tell the tale of Paschendale  
  
Cruelty has a human heart  
Every man does play his part  
Terror of the men we kill  
The human heart is hungry still  
  
I stand my ground for the very last time  
Gun is ready as I stand in line  
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow  
Rush of blood and over we go  
  
Blood is falling like the rain  
Its crimson cloak unveils again  
The sound of guns can't hide their shame  
And so we die on Paschendale  
  
Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire  
Running straight at the cannon fire  
Running blind as I hold my breath  
Say a prayer symphony of death  
  
As we charge the enemy lines  
A burst of fire and we go down  
I choke a cry but no-one hears  
Fell the blood go down my throat  
  
Home, far away  
From the war, a chance to live again  
Home, far away  
But the war, no chance to live again  
  
See my spirit on the wind  
Across the lines, beyond the hill  
Friend and foe will meet again  
Those who died at Paschendale

"White man came across the sea  
He brought us pain and misery  
He killed our tribes he killed our creed  
He took our game for his own need  
  
We fought him hard we fought him well  
Out on the plains we gave him hell  
But many came too much for Cree  
Oh will we ever be set free?  
  
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes  
Galloping hard on the plains  
Chasing the redskins back to their holes  
Fighting them at their own game  
Murder for freedom the stab in the back  
Women and children are cowards attack  
  
Run to the hills, run for your lives  
Run to the hills, run for your lives  
  
Soldier blue in the barren wastes  
Hunting and killing their game  
Raping the women and wasting the men  
The only good Indians are tame  
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold  
Enslaving the young and destroying the old  
  
Run to the hills, run for your lives

Oh, my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave.

When all you see can only bring you sadness,  
Like a river we will flow,  
On towards the sea we go,  
When all you do can only bring you sadness,  
Out on the sea of madness.  
  
Somewhere I hear a voice that's calling,  
Out in the dark there burns a dream,  
You got to hope when you are falling,  
To find the world that you have seen.

There ain't no wind to fill your sails,

"Eleven saintly shrouded men  
Silhouettes stand against the sky  
One in front with a cross held high  
Come to wash my sins away  
  
Standing alone in the wind and rain  
Feeling the fear that is growing  
Sensing the change in the tide again  
Brought by the storm that is brewing  
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear  
Some of the doubt in the things you believe  
Now that your faith will be put to the test  
Nothing to do but await what is coming  
  
Why then is god still protecting me  
Even when I don't deserve it  
Thought I am blessed with an inner strength  
Some they would call it a penance  
Why am I meant to face this alone  
Asking the question time and again  
Praying to God won't keep me alive  
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise  
  
They'll be saying their prayers  
when the moment comes  
There'll be penance to pay when it's judgment day  
And the guilty'll bleed when the moment comes  
They'll be coming to claim,  
take your soul away  
  
The sign of the cross  
The name of the rose  
a fire in the sky  
The sign of the cross  
  
They'll be coming to bring the eternal flame  
They'll be bringing us all immortality  
Holding communion so the world be blessed  
My creator my God'll lay my soul to rest  
  
Lost the love of heaven above  
Chose the lust of the earth below  
Eleven saintly shrouded men  
Came to wash my sins away

Waiting to make my move  
I make no sound  
  
Waiting for the mist to cover all around

The hunger and the pain  
A stop to look about then off again

And the wrong time  
Suspected of a hit that was my crime

We didn't know what was lying underneath  
So how could we be such fools  
And to think that we thought you the answer  
  
I can't begin to understand in all the lies  
But on your death bed I can see it in you eyes  
Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow  
It really makes sense I can see it clearly now  
  
Tangled up in a web of lies  
Could have been a way to prophesise  
Unaware of the consequence  
Not aware of the secrets that you kept  
  
Nothing that we could believe  
To reveal the facade of faceless men  
Not a thing that we could foresee  
Now a sign that would tell us the outcome  
  
You had us all strung out with  
Promises of peace  
But all along you cover plan was to deceive  
Can it put to rights now only time will tell  
Your prophecies will send us all to hell as well  
  
Left to all our golden sons  
All to pick up on the peace  
You could have given all of them  
A little chance, at least  
  
Take the world to a better place  
Given them all just a little hope  
Just think what a legacy  
You know, will leave  
  
We seem destined to live in fear  
And some that would say Armageddon is near  
But where there's a life while there's hope  
That man won't self destruct  
  
Why can't we treat our fellow men  
With more respect and a shake of their hands  
But anger and loathing is rife  
The death on all sides is  
Becoming a way of life  
  
We live in an uncertain world  
Fear understanding and ignorance  
Is leading to death  
Only the corpses are left  
For vultures that prey on their bones  
  
But some are just not wanting peace  
Their whole life is death and misery  
The only thing that they know  
Fight fire with fire life is cheap  
  
But if they do stop to think  
That man is teetering right on the brink  
But do you think that they care  
They benefit from death and pain and despair

"Tough of the track,  
With the wind,  
And the rain that's beating down on your back.  
Your heart's beating loud  
And goes on getting louder  
And goes on even more till the sound  
Is ringing in your head,  
With every step you tread,  
And every breath you take,  
Determination makes  
  
You run,  
Never stop,  
Gotta win, gotta run till you drop,  
Keep the pace,  
Hold the race,  
Your mind is getting clearer,  
You're over halfway there but the miles  
Just never seem to end  
As if you're in a dream,  
Not getting anywhere.  
It seems so futile.  
  
Run, on and on,  
Run, on and on,  
The loneliness of the long distance runner.  
  
I've got to keep running the course,  
I've got to keep running and win at all costs,  
I've got to keep going, be strong,  
Must be so determined and push myself on.  
  
Run over stiles, across fields,  
Turn to look at who's on your heels,  
Way ahead of the field,  
The line is getting nearer but do  
You want the glory that goes,  
You reach the final stretch,  
Ideals are just a trace,  
You feel like throwing the race,  
It's all so futile.  
  
Run, on and on,  
Run, on and on,  
The loneliness of the long distance runner.

"Woe to you, oh earth and sea

Because he knows the time is short  
Let him who hath understanding  
Reckon the number of the beast  
For it is a human number  
Its number is six hundred and sixty six

To get the memories from my mind  
What did I see? Can I believe that what I saw  
That night was real and not just fantasy?  
  
Just what I saw in my old dreams  
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me  
'Cause in my dreams, it's always there  
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair  
  
Night was black, was no use holding back  
'Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?  
In the mist, dark figures move and twist  
Was all this for real or just some kind of Hell?  
  
6 6 6, the number of the beast  
Hell and fire was spawned to be released  
  
Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised  
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky  
In the night, the fires are burning bright  
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done  
  
6 6 6, the number of the beast  
Sacrifice is going on tonight  
  
This can't go on, I must inform the law  
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?  
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes  
Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes  
  
6 6 6, the number of the beast  
6 6 6, the one for you and me  
  
I'm coming back, I will return  
And I'll possess your body, and I'll make you burn  
I have the fire, I have the force  
I have the power to make my evil take its course

And we know deep down there's  
No other way  
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say  
  
Afraid to shoot strangers  
Afraid to shoot strangers

"""My son ask for thyself another  
Kingdom, for that which I leave  
is too small for thee""  
(King Philip of Macedonia - 339 B.C.)  
  
Near to the east  
In a part of ancient Greece  
In an ancient land called Macedonia  
Was born a son  
To Philip of Macedon  
The legend his name was Alexander  
  
At the age of nineteen  
He became the Macedon King  
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor  
By the Aegian Sea  
In 334 B.C.  
He utterly beat the armies of Persia  
  
[Chorus]  
Alexander the Great  
His name struck fear into hearts of men  
Alexander the Great  
Became a legend 'mongst mortal men  
  
King Darius the third  
Defeated fled Persia  
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes  
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well  
And he founded the city called Alexandria  
  
By the Tigris river  
He met King Darius again  
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela  
Entering Babylon  
And Susa, treasures he found  
Took Persepolis the capital of Persia  
  
[Chorus]  
Alexander the Great  
His name struck fear into hearts of men  
Alexander the Great  
Became a God amongst mortal men  
  
A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke  
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'  
And legend said that who untied the knot  
He would become the master of Asia  
  
Helonism he spread far and wide  
The Macedonian learned mind  
Their culture was a western way of life  
He paved the way for Christianity  
  
Marching on, marching on  
The battle weary marching side by side  
Alexander's army line by line  
They wouldn't follow him to India  
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory  
  
Alexander the Great  
His name struck fear into hearts of men  
Alexander the Great  
He died of fever in Babylon

As my wings get shot away.

Paper cats and burning barns,  
There's a fox among the chickens,  
And a killer in the hounds.  
  
Questions are a burden  
And answers are a prison for oneself  
Shellshock in the kitchen  
Tables start to burn.

Sometimes it makes me question  
Sometimes it makes me saddened  
Always it makes me angry but

Nobody seems to worry  
The World seems so powerless to act

The same day a new creation

Security of a world that brings  
  
One day another killing  
Somewhere there's someone starving  
Another a savage raping  
Meanwhile there's someone laughing at us

Expecting another air raid  
Praying for a ceasefire

No need to be complacent  
There's chaos across the border  
And one day it could be happening to us

You watch the red sun rise

Contaminated waters

Just waiting for disease to strike  
Oh will we learn someday?

No food, no love, no seed

"Let me tell you a story to chill the bones  
About a thing that I saw  
One night wandering in the everglades  
I'd one drink but no more  
  
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight  
Gazing up at the stars  
Not aware of a presence so near to me  
Watching my every move  
  
Feeling scared and I fell to my knees  
As something rushed me from the trees  
Took me to an unholy place  
And that is where I fell from grace  
  
Then they summoned me over to join in with them  
To the dance of the dead  
Into the circle of fire I followed them  
Into the middle I was led  
  
As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear  
But still I wanted to go  
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me  
As I walked onto the coals  
  
And I felt I was in a trance  
And my spirit was lifted from me  
And if only someone had the chance  
To witness what happened to me  
  
And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them  
All had death in their eyes  
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them  
They had ascended from hell  
  
As I danced with the dead  
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me  
Below my undead body  
Just danced the circle of dead  
  
Until the time came to reunite us both  
My spirit came back down to me  
I didn't know if I was alive or dead  
As the others all joined in with me  
  
By luck then a skirmish started  
And took the attention away from me  
When they took their gaze from me  
Was the moment that I fled  
  
I ran like hell faster than the wind  
But behind I did not glance  
One thing that I did not dare  
Was to look just straight ahead  
  
When you know that your time has come around  
You know you'll be prepared for it  
Say your last goodbyes to everyone  
Drink and say a prayer for it  
  
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed  
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead  
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed  
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead  
  
To this day I guess I'll never know  
Just why they let me go  
But I'll never go dancing no more  
'Til I dance with the dead

"Gotta tell you a story  
On a cold winter's night  
You'll be sailin' for glory  
Before you know what is right  
  
So come over here now  
I got a vision for you  
It's my personal snake oil  
It's just something I do  
  
I'm the jester with no tears  
And I'm playing on your fears  
I'm a trickster smiling underneath this mask of love and death  
The eternal lie I've told  
About the pyramids of gold  
I've got you hooked at every turn your money's left to burn  
  
You'll be wanting a contract  
You'll be waiting a while  
I'd like to give you my contact  
But that isn't my style  
  
Well you only get one chance  
And it's too good to miss  
if i didn't lie to ya  
Then I wouldn't exist  
  
Greed, lust and anvy pride  
It's the same old, same old ride  
The smoke and mirrors visions that you see are just like me  
I'm a banker's face  
With just a letter out of place  
I know someone just like you knows someone just like me  
  
El Dorado come and play  
El Dorado step this way  
Take a ticket for the ride  
El Dorado streets of gold  
See my ship is oversold  
You've got one last chance to try  
  
So gone is the glory  
And gone is the gold  
Well if you knew the story  
How come, it has to be told  
  
Well you can say I'm a devil  
And I wouldn't say no  
But out here on the dark side  
Hey, on with the show  
  
So now my tale is told  
Big and bad and twice as bold  
This ship of fools is sinking as the cracks begin to grow  
There is no easy way  
For an honest man today  
Which is something you should think of as my lifeboat sails away  
  
El Dorado come and play  
El Dorado step this way  
Take a ticket for the ride  
El Dorado streets of gold  
See my ship is oversold  
You've got one last chance to try  
  
El Dorado come and play  
El Dorado step this way  
Take a ticket for the ride  
El Dorado streets of gold  
See my ship is oversold  
You've got one last chance to try

"Why is it some of us are destined to stay alive  
And some of us are here just so that we'll die  
How come the bullet hits the other guy  
Do we have to try and reason why

Be it the devil or be it him  
You can count on just one thing  
When the time is up you'll know  
Not just one power runs the show  
  
Are we the lucky ones saved for another day  
Or they the lucky ones who are taken away  
Is it a hand on your shoulder from the lord above  
Or the devil himself come to give you a shove

A hurricane devastates the cities in its way

In a choking sweat of fear  
In the heat of the night you can  
Feel so much  
In the heat of the night I scream  
""Don't touch!""  
  
I remember a time when we  
Used and abused  
And fought all our battles in vain  
I remember a time we thought that  
Passion was free  
In the heart of the night, bodies aflame  
  
We live in fever  
  
I hear your secret heartbeat  
I can hear your silent cries  
The kids have lost their freedom  
And nobody cares till somebody  
Famous dies  
  
I remember a time when we  
Used and abused  
And fought all our battles in vain  
I remember a time we thought that  
Passion was free  
In the heart of the night, bodies aflame  
  
Now we live, in a world of uncertainty  
Fear is the key, to what you want to be  
You don't get a say the majority  
Gets its way  
You're outnumbered by the bastards  
Till the day you die

Getting ready to begin again  
  
Wounded, lying, crying  
Bodies moving and dying

Killing on a scale to comprehend  
  
Why are we here  
In this place... Here to kill  
Please God forgive us for  
What we have done  
  
I always thought I was doing right  
As of now I'm not feeling so sure  
  
I'm at a place of where  
I give no grace  
I'm a soldier of war  
  
I sit waiting for my darkest hour  
To come  
I cannot think about the things  
That I have done  
It shouldn't take a fool to see  
That I believe  
Accept the consequence  
Repent for what I've done  
  
You tell me what is certain  
But I'll tell you what is true  
You tell me that is honesty  
When all around is death and cruelty  
  
The making of a man is fire  
By giving in to our desires  
Within the truth that lies  
Within the only thing

Some say you're a Saint

Sufering and restraint  
  
Walk down the long dark road  
To ruin panic not  
I'll die a lonely death of that  
I'm certain of  
  
Rivers flow with blood  
There's nowhere left to hide  
It's hard to comprehend  
There's anyone left alive  
  
Sick of all the killing  
And the reek of death  
Will God tell me  
What religion is to man  
  
I don't hold with bad religion  
Understand what's underneath it  
Now I come to think of it  
I just don't hold at all you know it  
  
You say you are a holy man  
But what is it you do  
From where I stand is nothing  
But a hollow man I see

In a bloody hopeless war  
Don't know what I'm fighting  
Who it is or what I'm fighting for  
  
Though it was for money  
Make my fortune now I'm not  
So sure  
Seem to just have lost my way

"I remember it as plain as day  
Although it happened in the dark of the night.  
I was strolling through the streets of Paris  
And it was cold it was starting to rain.  
And then I heard a piercing scream  
And I rushed to the scene of the crime  
But all I found was the butchered remains  
Of two girls lay side by side.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Run before the killers go free  
  
There's some people coming down the street  
At last there's someone heard my call  
I can't understand why they're pointing at me  
I never done nothing at all.  
But I must have got some blood on my hands  
Because everyone's shouting at me  
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain  
And like a fool I started running away.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Am I ever gonna be free.  
  
And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law.  
All France is looking for me.  
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure  
Down the south to Italy.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
I'm never going home.  
  
Well I made it to the border at last  
But I can't erase the scene from my mind  
Anytime somebody stares at me, well  
I just start running blind  
Well I'm moving through the shadows at night  
Away from the staring eyes  
Any day they'll be looking for me  
'Cause I know I show the signs of...

Running from the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the arms of the law

Running from the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Am I ever gonna be free  
  
It took so long and I'm getting so tired  
I'm running out of places to hide  
Should I return to the scene of the crime  
Where the two young victims died  
If I could go to somebody for help  
It'd get me out of trouble for sure  
But I know that it's on my mind  
That my doctor said I've done it before.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
They're never gonna find me  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
I'm never going home.

There's no time to prepare  
Salvage a last horizon  
But no regrets from me  
  
Maybe I'll be back some other day  
To live again just who can say  
In what shape or form that I might be  
Just another chance for me  
  
A hurried time no disgrace  
Instead of racing to conclusion  
And wishing all my life away  
No-one can stop me now  
  
Time is up it couldn't last  
But there's more things I'd like to do  
I'm coming back to try again  
Someday maybe I'll wait till then  
  
No more lies  
  
They're all sitting at my table  
Talking tall and drinking wine  
Their time is up just like me  
But they just don't know it yet  
  
So just a word of warning  
When you're in your deepest dreams  
There's nothing you can hide from  
I've got my eye on you  
  
The clock is fast, the hour is near  
Eventful past is ever clear  
My life is set, the time is here  
I think I'm coming home

Instead of racing to conclusions  
And wishing all your life away

I'm coming back to try again  
Don't tell me that this is the end

You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you.  
  
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.  
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.  
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.

"In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth  
When the land was swamp and caves were home  
In an age when prize possession was fire  
To search for landscapes men would roam.  
  
Then the tribes they came to steal their fire  
And the wolves they howled into the night  
As they fought a vicious angry battle  
To save the power of warmth and light.  
  
Drawn by quest for fire  
They searched all through the land  
Drawn by quest for fire  
Discovery of man.  
  
And they thought that when the embers died away  
That the flame of life had burnt and died  
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire  
Were made by rubbing stick and stone.  
  
So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger  
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts  
In the search to find another fire  
To regain the power of light and heat.  
  
Drawn by quest for fire  
They searched across the land  
Drawn by quest for fire  
Discovery of man.

"In the heat of the morning  
When your day is still dawning  
And your bird, she's singing  
Catch your soul, he's willing to fly away  
  
Packed your bags in a hurry  
Because your mind's in a worry  
Mark my words, you're gonna be sorry if you ever fly away  
  
Sweet little girl with the Saint Da Vinci-smile  
Stares at me with sadness in her eyes  
I'm not sure if she's really real or make-believe  
Maybe she's a vision that comes to only me  
  
'Cause I'm so tired  
Yes I'm so tired  
So tired  
Yes I'm so tired  
  
In the heat of the morning

And your bird, she's singing  
Catch your soul, he's willing to fly away

"When I was wandering in the desert  
And was searching for the truth  
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name  
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again  
I turned my face towards the barren sun  
  
And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me  
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves  
And the cracks in our lives like the cracks upon the ground  
They are sealed and are now washed away

You tell me we can start the rain  
You tell me that we all can change  
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away

You tell me we can find something to wash the tears

"Unchain the colors before my eyes,  
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.  
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,  
I shall return from out of fire.

Tears for somebody and this lonely boy.  
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,  
Flickers above us, to light up the sky.  
  
Unchain the colours before my eyes,  
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.  
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,  
I shall return from out of fire.

"""O God of Earth and Altar,  
Bow down and hear our cry,  
Our earthly rulers falter,  
Our people drift and die,  
The walls of gold entomb us,  
The swords of scorn divide,  
Take not thy thunder from us,  
But take away our pride.""  
(G. K. Chesterton English Hymnal)  
  
Just a babe in the black abyss,  
No reason for a place like this,  
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain,  
An easy way for the blind to go,  
A clever path for the fools who know  
the Secret of the Hanged Man-the smile on his lips.  
The light of the Blind-you'll see,  
The venom that tears my spine,  
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.  
  
She came to me with a serpent's kiss,  
As the Eye of the Sun Rose on her lips,  
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,  
So we lay in the black embrace,  
And the Seed is sown in a holy place  
And I watched, and I waited for the dawn.  
  
The light of the Blind-you'll see,  
The venom that tears my spine,  
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.  
  
Bind all of us together,  
Ablaze with Hope and Free,  
No storm or heavy weather  
Will rock the boat you'll see.  
The time has come to close your eyes  
And still the wind and rain,  
For the one who will be King  
Is the Watcher in the Ring,  
It is You  
It is You

"Hear the rime of the ancient mariner  
See his eye as he stops one of three  
Mesmerizes one of the wedding guests  
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea.  
  
And the music plays on, as the bride passes by  
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale.  
  
Driven south to the land of the snow and ice  
To a place where nobody's been  
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross  
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings.  
  
And the ship sails on, back to the North  
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on.  
  
The mariner kills the bird of good omen  
His shipmates cry against what he's done  
But when the fog clears, they justify him  
And make themselves a part of the crime.  
  
Sailing on and on and north across the sea  
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm.  
  
The albatross begins with it's vengeance  
A terrible curse a thirst has begun  
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner  
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.  
  
And the curse goes on and on at sea  
And the curse goes on and on for them and me.  
  
""Day after day, day after day,  
We stuck nor breath nor motion  
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean  
Water, water everywhere and  
All the boards did shrink  
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink.""  
  
There calls the mariner  
There comes a ship over the line  
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?  
  
She... onward she comes  
Onward she nears out of the sun  
See, she has no crew  
She has no life, wait but here's two.  
  
Death and she life in death,  
They throw their dice for the crew  
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now.  
Then, crew one by one  
They drop down dead, two hundred men  
She, she, Life in Death.  
She lets him live, her chosen one.  
  
""One after one by the star dogged moon,  
Too quick for groan or sigh  
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang  
And cursed me with his eye  
Four times fifty living men  
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)  
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,  
They dropped down one by one.""  
  
The curse it lives on in their eyes  
The mariner he wished he'd die  
Along with the sea creatures  
But they lived on, so did he.  
  
And by the light of the moon  
He prays for their beauty not doom  
With heart he blesses them  
God's creatures all of them too.  
  
Then the spell starts to break  
The albatross falls from his neck  
Sinks down like lead into the sea  
Then down in falls comes the rain.  
  
Hear the groans of the long dead seamen  
See them stir and they start to rise  
Bodies lifted by good spirits  
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes  
  
And revenge is still sought, penance starts again  
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.  
  
Now the curse is finally lifted  
And the mariner sights his home  
Spirits go from the long dead bodies  
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone.  
  
And then a boat came sailing towards him  
It was a joy he could not believe  
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit,  
Penance of life will fall onto him.  
  
And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea  
And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins.  
  
The mariner's bound to tell of his story  
To tell this tale wherever he goes  
To teach God's word by his own example  
That we must love all things that God made.  
  
And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man  
And the tale goes on and on and on.

Price for failure of your will

A cunning fox in the chickens lair  
A hound of hell and the devil don't care

Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer  
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare  
A silent death lies awaiting, for all of you below  
Running silent, running deep, sink into your silent sleep  
  
Chill the hearts of fighting men  
In open ocean wondering when?  
The lethal silver fish will fly  
The boat will shiver-men will die  
A cast of millions-a part to play  
Killer victim or fool for a day  
Obeying an order-men have to die  
Us or them-a well rehearsed lie

Here I am, can you see me  
Passing through, on my way  
To a place I'd been to only in my  
Dreams before  
  
In a world of delusion  
Never turn your back on a friend  
'cause you can count your  
Real true friends on one hand  
  
Through life  
  
There are those that deceive you  
There are those that'll let you down  
Is there someone out there that would  
Die for you  
Thought not  
  
Live your life with a passion  
Everything you do, do well  
You only get out of life what you put in  
So they say  
  
In a world of confusion  
People never say what they mean  
If you want a straight answer  
Go look for one  
Right now  
  
In a room full of strangers  
Do you stand with your back to the wall  
Do you sometimes feel like you're  
On the outside  
Looking in?  
  
You can make your own luck  
You create your destiny  
I believe you have the power  
If you want to  
It's true  
  
You can do what you want to  
If you try a little bit harder  
A little bit of faith goes a long way  
It does  
  
Are we here for a reason?  
I'd like to know just what you think  
It would be nice to know what  
Happens when we die  
Wouldn't it?  
There are some who are wise  
There are some who are born naive  
I believe that there are some that must  
Have lived before  
Don't you?  
  
As for me, well I'm thinking  
You gotta keep an open mind  
But I hope that my life's not an  
Open and shut case  
  
Extrasensory Perception  
Life after death, telepathy  
Can the soul live on and travel through  
Space and time?  
  
You know I feel so elated  
'cause I'm about to find it out  
And when I know all the answers  
Maybe then I'll come back  
To fill you in  
  
You don't be alarmed now  
If I try to contact you  
If things go missing or get moved around  
It's me  
And don't disbelieve it  
No matter what your ""friends""  
Might say  
We'll meet up again someplace  
Some way  
One day

"Now the contracts out  
They've put the word about  
I'm coming after you  
  
It's not the money I make  
It's the thrill of the chase  
And I'm coming after you  
  
I watch your every move  
Study the things you do  
And the pattern of your ways  
  
I watch the way you walk  
I hear your telephone talk  
I want to understand the way you think  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Better watch out, cause I'm the assassin,  
Better watch out, better watch out  
  
I'm in a cold cold sweat  
I taste the smell of death  
I know the moment's getting closer  
  
And as you walk to the light  
I feel my hands go tight  
Excitement running through my veins  
  
I've got you in my sights  
I've got you dead to rights  
The triggers waiting for my finger  
  
I feel adrenalin rush  
It's just the final touch  
You can kiss your ass goodbye

"Feel the sweat break on my brow  
Is it me or is it shadows that are  
Dancing on the walls  
Is this a dream or is it now  
Is this a vision or normality I see  
Before my eyes  
  
I wonder why I wonder how  
That it seems that the powers getting stronger  
Every day  
I feel a strength an inner fire  
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore  
  
There's a time to live and a time to die  
When it's time to meet the maker  
There's a time to live but isn't it strange  
That as soon as you're born you're dying  
  
Just by looking through your eyes  
He could see the future penetrating right  
In through your mind  
See the truth and see your lies  
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise  
  
There's a time to live and a time to die  
When it's time to meet the maker  
There's a time to live but isn't it strange  
That as soon as you're born you're dying  
And reborn again?

"Wake alone in the hills

It's a land wrought with change

They would turn in their graves  
They would all be ashamed

Has been written in chains

A lunge and a feint, a parry too late  
A cut to the chest and you're down  
Seeing the stain then feeling the pain  
Feeling the sweat on your brow.

Meanwhile the Reaper looks on.

"I've looked into the heart of darkness  
Where the blood red journey ends  
When you've faced the heart of darkness  
Even your soul begins to bend  
  
For a week I have been waiting  
Still I am only in Saigon  
The walls move in a little closer  
I feel the jungle call me on  
  
Every minute I get weaker  
While in the jungle they grow strong  
What I wanted was a mission  
And for my sins they gave me one  
  
They brought it up just like room service  
Cause everyone gets what they want  
And when that mission was all over  
I'd never want another one  
  
I know, captain that you've done this work before  
We've got a problem you can help us all I'm sure  
The colonel's gone rogue  
and his methods are unsound  
You'll take a PBR up river track him down  
  
There's a conflict in every human heart  
And the temptation is to take it all too far  
In this war things get so confused  
But there are some things which can not be excused  
  
He's acting like a god an insane lunatic  
Your mission, exterminate with extreme prejudice  
The route is dangerous and your progress may be slow  
Here is the file and it's all you need to know  
  
Here I am the knife in my hand  
And now I understand why the genius must die  
  
Now I stand alone in darkness  
With his blood upon my hands  
Where sat the warrior the poet  
Now lie the fragments of a man

Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn

"In the gloom the gathering storm abates  
In the ships gimlet eyes await  
The call to arms to hammer at the gates  
To blow them wide throw evil to its fate  
  
All summers long the drills to build the machine  
To turn men from flesh and blood to steel  
From paper soldiers to bodies on the beach  
From summer sands to Armageddon's reach  
  
Overlord, your master not your god  
The enemy coast dawning Grey with scud  
These wretched souls puking, shaking fear  
To take a bullet for those who sent them here  
  
The world's alight, the cliffs erupt in flame  
No escape, remorseless shrapnel rains  
Drowning men no chance for a warrior's fate  
A choking death enter hell's gate  
  
Sliding we go, only fear on our side  
To the edge of the wire,  
And we rush with the tide  
Oh the water is red,  
With the blood of the dead  
But I'm still alive, pray to God I survive

'Til we finally make it through  
How long on this longest day  
'Til we finally make it through

They are relieved, the living wait their turn  
Your number's up, the bullet's got your name  
You still go on, to hell and back again  
  
Valhalla waits, valkyries rise and fall  
The warrior tombs, lie open for us all  
A ghostly hand reaches through the veil  
Blood and sand, we will prevail  
  
Sliding we go, only fear on our side  
To the edge of the wire,  
And we rush with the tide  
Oh the water is red,  
With the blood of the dead  
But I'm still alive, pray to God I survive

You'd better stand there's no turning back

But on this battlefield no one wins  
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath  
As you plunge into a certain death  
  
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run  
The mighty roar of the Russian guns  
And as we race towards human wall  
The screams of pain as my comrades fall  
  
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground  
And as the Russians fire another round  
We get so near yet so far away  
We won't live to fight another day  
  
We get so close near enough to fight  
When a Russian gets me in his sights  
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow  
A burst of rounds takes my horse below  
  
And as I lay there gazing at the sky  
My body's numb and my throat is dry  
And as I lay forgotten and alone  
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

I'm on my way, out on the road again, I'm on my way, out on my own again,  
I'm on my way, I'm gonna break away,
