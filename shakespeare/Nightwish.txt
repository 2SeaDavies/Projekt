The stars they have whispered  
Hear what they say  
And know that it means  
  
The moon is your guide  
The stars they have kissed her  
As she goes gently by  
Light as a baby's eye  
Safe on a fairytale stream  
  
And start a new dream

"A nocturnal concerto  
Candlelight whispers me where to go  
Hymn of gathering stars as my guide  
Whilst I wander on this path of the night  
  
Embroidery of the stars  
Undress my feelings for this earth  
Send me your saliva to heal my scars  
And let this nakedness be my birth  
  
Macrocosm poured its powers on me  
And the hopes of this world I now must leave  
The night wish I sent you centuries ago

The distance of our bridal bed  
Await for me to be dead  
Dust of the galaxies take my hand  
Lead me to my beloved's land  
  
Departed by the guillotine of death  
I received a letter from the depth  
The dream of my lover it carried inside  
  
Caressed by the sharpest knife  
I asked you to be my wife  
Rays of the setting sun  
Were my tears wept upon promises undone  
  
Come to me  
Make me believe  
To you and your love again  
  
Above the universe  
Beneath the great eye  
I shall desire you forevermore

Bare grace for the end of days

Spoiled Lucrece lies warm for you

The moon and the dreams we shared  
Your trembling paw in my hand  
Dreaming of that northern land  
Touching me with a kiss of a beast

Your voice tears me asunder

Forgive me I need more than you can offer me

Where happily ever after was to kiss a frog?  
Don't you know this tale  
In which all I ever wanted  
I'll never have  
For who could ever learn to love a beast?

I'll be there to ease your pain  
However cruel the mirrors of sin  
Remember beauty is found within  
  
Forever shall the wolf in me  
Desire the sheep in you

A burning veil  
For the bride too dear for him  
A sin for him  
Desire within  
Fall in love with your deep dark sin  
  
I am the Fallen  
You are what my sins enclose  
Lust is not as creative  
As its discovery  
  
To paradise with pleasure haunted by fear  
  
A sin for him  
  
Bless me, undress me  
Pick your prey in a wicked way  
God I must confess  
I do envy the sinners

"Don't give me love, don't give me faith.  
Wisdom not pride, give innocence instead. Don't give me love, I've had my
share. Beauty not rest, give me truth instead. A crow flew to me, kept its
distance. Such a proud creation. I saw it's soul, envied it's pride. But
needed nothing it had. An owl came to me, old and wise. Pierced right through
my youth. I learned its ways, envied it's sense.  
But needed nothing it had.  
Don't give me love, don't give me faith.  
Wisdom not pride, give innocence instead.  
Don't give me love, I've had my share. Beauty not rest, give me truth instead.
A dove came to me, had no fear. It rested on my arm. I touched its calm,
envied its love.  
But needed nothing it had.  
A swan of white, she came to me. The lake mirrored her beauty sweet. I kissed
her neck, adored her grace. But needed nothing she could give.  
Got to grieve her, got to wreck it.  
Got to grieve her, got to wreck it.  
Got to grieve her, got to wreck it.  
Got to grieve her, got to wreck it.  
Got to grieve her, got to wreck it.  
Got to grieve her, got to wreck it.

Don't give me love, don't give me faith.  
Wisdom not pride, give innocence instead. Don't give me love, I've had my

Whence the endless tick-tick stream begins

If tales aren't just for children to see  
That it's peace if sleep walks with me

Riddler Riddler ask me why  
All mothers beneath the Earth and sky  
Hold their children's hands for a while  
Their hearts forever - yours and mine  
  
Make me wonder what's the meaning of life  
What's the use to be born and then die  
Make me guess who's the one  
Behind the mask of Father and Son

Not by the hands of where's and why's  
But by the Oceans' minds

"I went into the wilderness with Uncle Walt  
I discovered the wild  
Learning to suck all the experience  
Seeing the world through cradle's bars  
  
The wild blessed me with an errant mind  
Showing the way for the ultimate lore  
I went around the world, beyond the wild  
Finding my home from an ocean shore  
  
Wayfarer, heart lander  
What if I only had  
One more night to live  
  
Home is where the way is  
My road goes on forever  
One more voyage to go  
  
Dead to the world  
Alive for the journey

Tears laid for them

This loneliness I need to be who I am

One night the clock struck twelve  
The window opened wide  
Once there was a child's heart

And took a step outside  
  
Once I knew all the tales  
It's time to turn back time  
Follow the pale moonlight  
Once I wished for this night  
Faith brought me here  
It's time to cut the rope and fly  
  
To a dream  
Far across the sea  
All the burdens gone  
Open the chest once more  
Dark chest of wonders  
Seen through the eyes  
Of the one with pure heart  
Once so long ago  
  
The one in the Big Blue is what the world stole from me  
This night will bring him back to me  
  
Fly to a dream

Created a kingdom, reached for the wisdom  
Failed in becoming a god

Where being wanted became a thrill I never knew

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young.  
In a world of magnets and miracles  
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary,  
The ringing of the division bell had begun.  
  
Along the Long Road and on down to the causeway,  
Do they still meet there by the Cut  
  
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps  
Running before time took our dreams away  
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground,  
To a life consumed by slow decay.  
  
The grass was greener  
The light was brighter  
With friends surrounding  
The nights of wonder  
  
Looking beyond the embers of the bridges glowing behind us  
To a glimpse at our great lose of the other side  
Steps taken forward but sleepwalking back again,  
Dragged by force of some inner tide  
  
But the highest altitude with flag unfurled  
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world  
  
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition,  
There's hunger still unsatisfied,  
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon,  
Though down this road we've been so many times.  
  
The grass was greener  
The light was brighter  
The taste was sweeter  
The nights of wonder  
With friends surrounded  
The dark mist growing  
The water flowing  
The endless river  
Forever and ever [x2]

Wildflowers, those meadows of heaven, wind in the wheat  
  
A railroad across waters, the scent of grandfatherly love  
Blue bayous, Decembers, moon through a dragonfly's wings  
  
Where is the wonder where's the awe  
Where's dear Alice knocking on the door  
Where's the trapdoor that takes me there  
Where's the real is shattered by a Mad Marsh Hare  
  
Where is the wonder where's the awe  
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for  
Before the years take me  
I wish to see  
The lost in me  
  
I want my tears back  
I want my tears back now  
  
A ballet on a grove, still growing young all alone  
A rag doll, a best friend, the voice of Mary Costa

"What does the free fall feel like?  
Asks the boy with a spark in his eye  
Know why the nightingale sings?  
Is the answer to everything  
Taking a step to a world unbound  
Spinning my fantasies all around  
Freed from the gravital leash  
I swear the heaven's in my reach  
Dancing with the spirit of the air  
In this ocean so open and fair  
Making love to the gods above  
On my maiden voyage so bold  
Landing safely to the blue lagoon  
Don't know if this is the earth or the moon  
Joy of living is no more a mask  
The Eden I found will forever last  
Migrating with the geese  
My soul has finally found peace  
Doesn't matter that man has no wings  
As long as I hear the nightingale sing...

"A single grain can tip the scale  
Amidst the burden, the scale will prevail  
Showing what's worth being here  
Storyteller by a hearth of stone  
A white little creature purring me  
My childhood kingdom gone in time  
The islands filling my mind with blue  
The one in special, heaven?s court  
All the joy unforgiven by this task  
An errant soul, homeless and foul  
All gone but the will to live to tell the tale  
The days are filled with anxiety  
Frustration, one right note a day  
Where to find a perfect tune  
Just do the work and take a step back  
All the joy unforgiven by this task  
An errant soul, homeless and foul  
All gone but the will to live to tell the tale  
Dark chambers of my mind  
Locked around the neck of my love  
None of you understand and it doesn't matter  
To a broken marionette like me  
(Me)  
An errant soul, homeless and foul  
An errant soul, homeless and foul  
All gone but the will to live to tell the, to tell the tale

"I'm a priest for the poorest sacrifice  
I'm but a raft in a sea of sorrow and greed  
You bathed in my wine  
Drank from my cup, mocked my rhyme  
Your slit tongues licked my aching wounds  
  
Put a stake through my heart!  
And drag me into sunlight  
So awake for your greed  
As you're slaying the dreamer  
  
Swansong for the Wish of Night  
God it hurts, give a name to the pain  
Our primrose path to hell is growing weed  
  
Blame me, it's me  
Coward, a good for nothing scapegoat  
Dumb kid, living a dream  
Romantic only on paper  
  
Tell me why you took all that was mine!  
Stay as you lay don't lead me astray!  
  
Wake up, mow the weed  
You'd be nothing without me  
Take my life if you have the heart to die  
  
You bastards tainted my tool  
Raped my words, played me a fool  
Gather your precious glitter and leave me be  
The Great Ones are all dead  
And I'm tired, too  
  
I truly hate you all!

Once upon a century  
Wistful oceans calm and red  
Ardent caresses laid to rest

For wishes I behold my night

Losing faith makes a crime  
  
I wish for this night-time

Shores of a solar sea  
Oh how I wish to go down with the sun  
Sleeping  
Weeping

Sorrow has a human heart  
From my god it will depart  
I'd sail before a thousand moons  
Never finding where to go  
  
Two hundred twenty-two days of light  
Will be desired by a night  
A moment for the poet's play  
Until there's nothing left to say

Now he's home in Hell, serves him well  
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell

Remains of the dark passion play  
Performed by his friends without shame  
Spitting on his grave as they came

We're surfing in the air  
We're swimming in the frozen sky  
We're drifting over icy  
Mountains floating by  
  
Suddenly swooping low on an ocean deep  
Arousing of a mighty monster from its sleep  
  
We're walking in the air  
We're floating in the midnight sky  
And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly

"I want to see where the sirens sing  
Hear how the wolves howl  
Sail the dead calm waters of the pacific  
  
Dance in the fields of coral  
Be blinded by the white  
Discover the deepest jungle  
  
I want to find the secret path  
A bird delivered into my heart, so  
  
It's not the end  
Not the kingdom come  
It is the journey that matters, the distant wanderer  
Call of the wild  
In me forever and ever and ever forever  
Wanderlust  
  
I want to love by the blue lagoon  
Kiss under the waning moon  
Straying, claiming my place in this mortal coil  
  
Riding the dolphins  
Asking the mountains  
Dreaming Alaska  
The earth can have but earth  
  
I want to find  
  
It's not the end  
  
Look into my eyes and see the wanderer  
See the mirrors of a wolf behold the pathfinder

"Still  
Spinning 'round in my head  
How I regret everything that I said  
Why did I tell you to go?  
Saving my pride but losing my soul  
  
I'm here all alone  
Still wait by the phone  
The hours go by  
What else could I do but to cry  
  
I call, and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I beg, and I cry  
I keep asking why  
Where were you last night?  
Where were you last night?  
  
Lost  
In the dark and my fears  
If only you saw the tracks of my tears  
I think I'm losing my mind  
Where did you go, and what did you find?  
  
I'm here all alone  
Still wait by the phone  
The hours go by  
What else could I do but to cry?  
  
I call, and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I beg, and I cry  
I keep asking why  
Where were you last night?

I keep asking why

Just to make things right

"Sweet little words made for silence not talk  
Young heart for love not heartache  
Dark hair for catching the wind  
Not to veil the sight of a cold world  
  
Kiss while your lips are still red  
While he's still silent  
Rest while bosom is still untouched, unveiled  
Hold another hand while the hand's still without a tool  
Drown into eyes while they're still blind  
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn  
  
First day of love never comes back  
A passionate hour's never a wasted one  
The violin, the poet's hand  
Every thawing heart plays your theme with care  
  
Kiss while your lips are still red  
While he's still silent  
Rest while bosom is still untouched, unveiled  
Hold another hand while the hand's still without a tool  
Drown into eyes while they're still blind  
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn  
  
Kiss while your lips are still red  
While he's still silent  
Rest while bosom is still untouched, unveiled  
Hold another hand while the hand's still without a tool  
Drown into eyes while they're still blind  
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn  
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn

"We seduce the dark with pain and rapture  
Like two ships that pass in the night  
You and I, a whore and a bashful sailor  
Welcome to a sunrise of a dirty mind  
  
All your love is a lie  
You one-night butterfly  
Hurt me, be the one  
Whoever brings the night  
  
The dark, created to hide the innocent white, the lust of night  
Eyes so bright, seductive lies  
Crimson masquerade where I merely played my part  
Poison dart of desire  
  
All your love is a lie  
You one-night butterfly  
Hurt me, be the one  
Whoever brings the night  
  
Choose a bride tonight  
A fantasy for a zombie  
Hurt me, I love to suffer  
Your harems are dreams for free  
  
Enter  
Suck form us and live for ever  
Rotten beauty  
Will haunt you for a lifetime  
  
Come with me on underwater  
And drown to despise me no more  
Unholy, unworthy  
My night is a dream for free  
  
All your love is a lie  
You one-night butterfly  
Hurt me, be the one  
Whoever brings the night  
All your love is a lie  
You one-night butterfly  
Hurt me, be the one  
  
Whoever brings the night  
Whoever brings the night

I miss your smile  
I miss everything about you  
Every second is like a minute  
Every minute's like a day  
When you're far away

A dreamy-eyed child staring into night  
On a journey to storyteller's mind  
Whispers a wish speaks with the stars the words are silent in him  
Distant sigh from a lonely heart

"Tear me to bits enjoy the scene  
Of screen name verbal vanity  
Churning the words embued in filth  
Your tongue oily water under my bridge  
  
You have the world  
It's all for you  
I wish you'd find the lost in you  
Grateful for the pain  
It proves we're alive  
Can you feel it?  
  
I can't make you want the truth  
It's up to you!  
  
Yours is an empty hope  
Yours is an empty hope  
  
Feed me to pigs in your fantasies  
Your sea roars bitter elegies  
Like narcissus who bribes the pool  
A hollow voice, ruin with a roof  
  
Stop! Life is now, still all for you  
Turn from the hate  
Turn from the smoke  
I see the parchment of your soul  
The note, the song  
Join your voice  
  
I can't let you have the world  
It's all for you!  
  
Yours is an empty hope  
Yours is an empty hope
