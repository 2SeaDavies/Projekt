"Just about a year ago  
I set out on the road  
Seekin' my fame and fortune  
Lookin' for a pot of gold  
Thing got bad and things got worse  
I guess you know the tune  
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again  
  
Rode in on the Greyhound  
I'll be walkin' out if I go  
I was just passin' through  
Must be seven months or more  
Ran out of time and money  
Looks like they took my friends  
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again  
  
A man from the magazine  
Said I was on my way  
Somewhere I lost connections  
Ran out of songs to play  
I came into town, a one night stand  
Looks like my plans fell through  
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again  
  
If I only had a dollar  
For every song I've sung  
Every time I had to play  
While people sat there drunk  
You know, I'd catch the next train  
Back to where I live  
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again  
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again

"
"Put a candle in the window  
'Cause I feel I've gotta move.  
Though I'm goin', goin'  
I'll be comin' home soon  
Long as I can see the light.  
  
Pack my bag and let's get moving  
'Cause I'm bound to drift awhile.  
Though I'm gone, gone  
You don't have to worry  
Long as I can see the light.  
  
Guess I've got that old travelin' bone  
'Cause this feeling won't leave alone.  
But I won't, won't  
Be losin' my way  
Long as I can see the light.  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Put a candle in the window  
'Cause I feel I've gotta move  
Though I'm goin', goin'  
I'll be comin' home soon  
Long as I can see the light  
Long as I can see the light  
Long as I can see the light  
Long as I can see the light  
Long as I can see the light.

"[Chorus]  
I'm lookin' for a reason to stay.  
I'm all wound up and tied in knots today.  
I'm lookin' for a reason not to go.  
When the morning comes, I'll be on my way.  
  
Ev'ry night I ask myself again  
Just what it was that made our dream begin.  
It seemed like a good idea way back then.  
But I'm wond'rin' now what daydream took me in.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yesterday I tried once more to find  
A way to share the trouble on my mind.  
It seems like you turn away ev'ry time.  
I used to like it here, I can't remember why.  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]

"
"Yes, my baby left me, never said a word.  
Was it something I done, something that she heard?  
You know she left me, my baby left me.  
My baby even left me, never said a word.  
  
But, I stand at my window, wring my hands and cry.  
I hate to lose that woman, hate to say goodbye.  
You know she left me, I say, she left me.  
My baby even left me, never said goodbye.  
Help me, boy!  
  
And now, one of these mornings, lord, it won't be long,  
  
You'll look for me and, baby, daddy he'll be gone.  
You know she left me, I say she left me.  
My baby even left me, never said a word.  
  
Now, I stand at my window, wring my hands and moan.  
All I know is that the one I love is gone.  
My baby left me, I say she left me.  
My baby even left me, never said goodbye.  
My baby even left me, never said goodbye.

"I got to have all your love, night and day.  
Not just a little part, but all of your heart, sugar.  
  
[Chorus]  
Ninety-nine and a half just won't do.  
Oh, no, no, just won't get it.  
  
Don' t be led in the wrong direction.  
To start this thing off right, a man need a little love and affection,  
Yes he do, now.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All right.  
Lookie here,  
  
We got to bring it all down, start gettin' it right.  
  
We got to stop this messin' around, and keep the thing up tight,  
Yes we do, now.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All right, sugar.  
Got to have a hundred,  
Got to have a hundred.  
All right.  
Ooh, I must do, I must do,  
I must do now.  
  
Oh! got to have a hundred!  
Got to have a hundred!  
Oh! got to have a hundred, too right.  
Got to have a hundred, now. oh!

"It's been an awful long time since I been home,  
But you won't catch me goin' back down there alone.  
Things they said when I was young are quite enough to get me hung.  
I don't care! I don't care!  
  
They came and took my dad away to serve some time,  
But it was me that paid the debt he left behind.  
Folks said I was full of sin, because I was the next of kin.  
I don't care! I don't care!  
  
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo!  
I don't care! I don't care!  
  
Folks were out one night to put me up a fence,  
And you can guess that I've been runnin' ever since.  
Ain't no one that's 'bout to help, and I'll keep on, I tell myself.  
I don't care! I don't care!  
  
I don't care! I don't care!  
I don't care! I don't care!  
  
Ain't no one that's 'bout to help,  
And I'll keep on, I tell myself.  
I don't care! I don't care!  
I don't care! I don't care!  
I don't care! I don't care!  
I don't care! I don't care!  
I don't care! I don't care!

"Whoa thought it was a nightmare  
Lord it was so true  
  
They told me don't go walking slow  
The devil's on the loose  
  
Better run through the jungle  
Better run through the jungle  
Better run through the jungle  
Whoa don't look back to see  
  
Thought I heard a rumblin'  
Calling to my name  
  
Two hundred million guns are loaded  
Satan cries ""take aim""  
  
Better run through the jungle  
Better run through the jungle  
Better run through the jungle  
Whoa don't look back to see  
  
Over on the mountain, thunder magic spoke  
Let the people know my wisdom  
Fill the land with smoke  
  
Better run through the jungle  
Better run through the jungle  
Better run through the jungle  
Whoa don't look back to see

"First thing I remember was asking papa, why,  
For there were many things I didn't know.  
And daddy always smiled and took me by the hand,  
Saying, someday you'll understand.  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,  
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,  
'Cause someday never comes.  
  
Well, time and tears went by and I collected dust.  
For there were many things I didn't know.  
When daddy went away, he said, try to be a man,  
And someday you'll understand.  
  
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,  
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,  
'Cause someday never comes.  
  
And then one day in April, I wasn't even there,  
For there were many things I didn't know.  
A son was born to me. Mama held his hand,  
Sayin' someday you'll understand.  
  
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,  
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,  
'Cause someday never comes  
Ooo someday never comes.  
  
Think it was September, the year I went away,  
For there were many things I didn't know.  
And I still see him standing, tryin' to be a man,  
I said, someday you'll understand.  
  
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,  
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,  
'Cause someday never comes  
Ooo someday never comes.

"Big wheels keep on turning  
Carry me home to see my kin  
Singing songs about the Southland  
I miss Alabamy once again  
And I think it's a sin, yes  
Well I heard mister Young sing about her  
Well, I heard ole Neil put her down  
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember  
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow

Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet Home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you

Now Watergate does not bother me  
Does your conscience bother you?  
Tell the truth

Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet Home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
Here I come Alabama  
  
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers  
And they've been known to pick a song or two  
Lord they get me off so much  
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue  
Now how about you?

Where the skies are so blue

Yea, yea Montgomery's got the answer

"If maybe you'd move over,  
Gave someone else a chance to try their luck,  
Instead, you run up closer,  
Try'n to grab a page before they close the book.  
  
[Chorus]  
It was over 'fore it started, seemed so long when we began  
Hope you take it like a friend.  
It's a shame to see you cryin' , wouldn't think to way back when,  
Looks like i'll never hear the end.  
  
Thought you had the honor,  
Took special pride in all your well laid plans.  
  
Forgot about the others,  
We moved out t'ward the light showin' empty hands.

Ah, put the boot down! mm-hm!  
  
Love to be the winner.  
Gather up your chips in time to cash 'em in.  
We're all lookin' thinner,  
Playin' cards too close for either one to win.

It's a shame to see you cryin', wouldn't think to way back when,  
Hope you take it like a friend.

There's a shadow on my back.  
  
The man gave me a luck charm, cost five dollars more,  
Said, ""put some on your pillow, and put some on your door.""  
He said, ""take a long vacation, ooh,  
For thirteen months or more.""

"Long as I remember the rain been comin' down  
Clouds of mystery pourin' confusion on the ground.  
Good men through the ages tryin' to find the sun.  
And I wonder still I wonder who'll stop the rain.  
  
I went down Virginia seekin' shelter from the storm  
Caught up in the fable I watched the tower grow  
Five year plans and new deals wrapped in golden chains.  
And I wonder still I wonder who'll stop the rain.  
  
Heard the singers playin', how we cheered for more.  
The crowd had rushed together tryin' to keep warm.  
Still the rain kept pourin', fallin' on my ears  
And I wonder, still I wonder who'll stop the rain.

[Chorus]  
Wrote a song for everyone,  
Wrote a song for truth.  
Wrote a song For everyone  
And I couldn't even talk to you.  
  
Got myself arrested, wound me up in jail.  
Richmond 'bout to blow up, communication failed.  
If you see the answer, now's the time to say.  
All I want, all I want is to get you down and pray.

Saw the people standin' thousand years in chains.  
Somebody said it's different now, look, it's just the same.  
Pharoah's spin the message, 'round and 'round the truth.  
They could have saved a million people, how can I tell you?
