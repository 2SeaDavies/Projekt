"Johnny saw her riding on a street car named Desire, his fate was sealed  
She could see him coming like a hundred other liars, it was no big deal  
Rosa had a lover on the shady side of town, Tito, he was king of the streets  
She was his possession like a jewel on his crown, Johnny better run, better
run  
Chorus:  
Better hide your heart, better hold on tight  
Say your prayers, 'cause there's trouble tonight  
When pride and love battle with desire  
Better hide your heart, 'cause you're playing with fire  
  
The ride was over but the story doesn't end, he took her heart  
She looked him in the eye and said they couldn't meet again  
You could see the trouble start  
The word went out that Rosa's messin' with someone, it was on the street  
Tito looked for Johnny with a vengeance and a gun  
Johnny better run, better run  
  
Chorus  
  
Johnny's holdin' Rosa on a rooftop in the night, as time stood still  
They couldn't hear him coming 'til he had them both in sight  
You could feel a chill  
A shot ran out like thunder and the blood was on her hands, with nothing won  
When someone lies dying, lovers finally understand

Hold me, baby won't you touch me

Here I am, again in this city, with a fistful of dollars

Feels so good tonight, who cares about tomorrow

"I'm feelin' low, no place to go  
And I'm a-thinking that I'm gonna scream  
Because a hotel all alone is not a  
Rock and roll star's dream

A lady calls and asks if I'm too tired or if I'm just to dead for

Room service, I take the pleasure with the pain

They're gonna keep me waiting here till nine  
Then a stewardess in a tight blue dress says  
""I got the time""  
  
But just as I'm about to take my coat and get my flight  
She says ""Oh please"", she's on her knees  
And one more time before I leave I get some

With all the ladies treatin' me real good  
A sweet sixteen lookin' hot and mean says

I see her dad, he's getting mad  
All the time he knows that I'm in need of

His sandaled feet don't touch the ground

Vultures circle overhead  
Whatever gets you through the night
