"Spark and Cindy live by their own means  
They wouldn't have if I only  
Know'd where they'd been  
And I want to make things a part of my life  
And I want to see that  
Things are going to be right  
But if you can't even  
Stand on your feet  
And if you don't own the  
Air that you breathe  
Then it's not for me to say  
  
But I wouldn't live that way  
And I wouldn't stand apart  
And I wouldn't find the real  
And I wouldn't play a part  
And I wouldn't find in love  
So misguided by some fool  
And just what I'm trying t say  
Makes my head spin round the room

"Go take your bags away  
Get out of my home  
Get out of my life  
I don't want you hanging round  
And I don't want you to be my wife  
When I go to the cafe  
I sit in the seat that faces the mirror  
I look at my face today  
And I look such a wreck today  
I knew you well for five minutes and one day  
O-oh no way, Jose  
I don't ??? ugly views  
And I'm not interested in family muse  
And ?? is boring and conversation pours  
Even when we're in bed  
I wanna rearrange your head  
Put down the covers  
And get you up against the wall  
Shoot good babe  
Well I knew you well for five minutes and one day  
O-oh no way, Jose  
You follow where it's going  
Can't you see I was breaking  
How'd you know the love making wasn't only faking  
You get out of my home  
And you get out of my life  
You didn't hang around much girl  
'Cause now you're someone else's wife  
I go to the cafe  
And I sit in the seat that faces the mirror  
Well I look at my face today  
And I look so good today  
Well I knew you well for five minutes and one day  
O-oh no way, oh no way, oh no way, Jose  
You're just another girls names  
O-oh you're just another girls name (X3)

"She nails down moon beams  
And talks in double time  
Stumbling down to wherever she goes  
I live in the meantime  
And I get frustrated  
So I put my wager on Debris Road  
  
[Chorus]  
It keeps me running down Debris Road  
I'm not scared but it's somewhere I cling to  
All the places I (still) want to go  
They won't cast a shadow on my Debris Road  
  
I get frustrated looking for moonbeams  
They always fall where I never go  
'Cause I like the daylight and I like a good life  
Running so fast down Debris Road

Someone got moon-faced and someone gets tearful  
Talking so much that they really don't know  
Sitting up all night singing songs 'till daylight  
Striking a match with the devil below

You were looking for rhymes and reason  
They forgot the things you used to know

With the sky in the eye

You've made your own room at the top  
Well it's getting thin on air  
Still you look at me from your most expensive chair  
And when you're feeling fit to drop  
And you find there's no one there  
Still you look at me from your most expensive chair

When there's nothing you care to know  
Your friends they just laugh about it  
In the places that you never go  
You cannot deny your good fortune  
Your friends they won't let go  
See your hair is in place  
And see away from the window

When your castle's made of sand  
Because the people who kill the king  
Are the people who move from within

Your friends are crying low  
Kick your feet from the chair  
And let it slip from the gallow

But poets, they are too grim  
They steal like party thieves from crowded rooms  
To rhyme their homes with better places

Building up defenses  
Making up rules by which we play

The fireman tried but the hose was frozen  
The cupboard's bare but the door needs closing

From being where we want to

Waiting for a signal  
Waiting for night to return to day

The milk turned sour but my thirst needs quenching  
The meat was dead and I need me feeding

A baby's snatched on a beautiful morning  
A dog runs wild and the brakes are screaming  
A church on fire is struck by lightning

The princess frowned at her lovers mistress  
She went insane and poisoned the children  
A teacher's drowned and a child is laughing

All machines make our lives today  
And I like them the best  
But the mechanical thunder is  
It's just a noise in my head  
  
And the radio plays at me  
But it don't sing a song  
But the mechanical wonder is  
Ah, it's all going wrong  
  
And they rode it once (""and we rode it once"" on last chorus)  
On a thundering night  
So I walk with you  
Where the locks take flight  
And we keep on through  
It's where the road don't roar  
Where the farm once stood  
Where the union crawls, big time  
  
The machines that I'm walking from  
Though they play in the songs  
And the dreams that your holding on  
Don't run for so long  
  
So I'm hiding machines away  
But I keep them for you  
But the things that you want to say  
It's just a noise in my room  
  
And I look at the picture now  
And there's a weight on us all  
But the mechanical wonder is  
It's a cure one and all

You've been around the world and found it pleasing  
And every word is such a joke  
With so many pasts you'd be a hundred years old  
Don't you wonder why the room keeps on leaving  
Hey, hey, what's that I heard you say  
Don't think that I would never need it  
Hey, hey, what's that I heard you say  
Don't think that I would ever believe it

"Sonny signed his name up for tomorrow and laughed with all his friends  
At all the little men who borrows tunes they heard just yesterday  
Davey got us down but we got away and drank to all the days  
That we had whiled away just playing Robin Hood a little out of phase  
  
And then the nightmares come and you get blown away  
And up in your room, your walls are cold  
You find your head is holding out for the welcome of a better day  
  
And then the nightmares come and you get blown away  
And up in your room, your walls are getting colder  
Like you're getting on a roller coaster, you can't find the breaks  
  
Stevie burned the sky when he flew away and left us things to say  
When all the world was falling down around our shoulders, cold and gray  
Harry carried on in his usual way and Minnie went inside  
And came out once and we both cried and Minnie blew my head away  
  
When you're giving everything away, everybody lets you pay  
You're saving up for a better day, seeing things in a better way  
When you know you've got to live, there's nothing you won't give  
To hear the phone and not let it ring every Monday morning  
  
Shughie found love and he almost cried, we laughed and wondered why  
We love the sky and found the space and gazed out over Stevie's plane

"Up through all the streets you go  
But little girl don't find her name  
And we're all gone down roads to homes  
Where everybody finds their game  
  
Just behind the street she goes  
Where she'll be found behind her wheel  
'Cause it's the only place she knows  
That makes her know just how she feels  
  
'Cause you're the biggest thing  
That I see  
You've got me where you want me  
You hunt me down, you haunt me  
And beg me to believe  
  
All too fast to where she goes  
But who'll be first to find her name  
And holding on in Hollywood  
But holding on don't make the grade  
  
Just about when it's all right  
There's you and I : we'll find our way  
But it's holidays not Hollywood  
And holidays don't suit my game.  
  
'Cause you're the biggest thing  
That I see  
You've got me where you want me  
You hunt me down and haunt me  
And beg me to believe  
  
Hollow days and hollow nights  
But everyone they find their way  
It hightlights you when things ain't right  
And makes you want to find your place  
  
'Cause you're the biggest thing  
That I see  
You've got me where you want me  
You hunt me down, you haunt me  
And beg me to believe  
  
'Cause you're the biggest thing  
That I see  
You've got me where you want me  
You hunt me down,you haunt me  
And beg me to believe

"Charlie brown says  
No-one promised this when i was a kid  
When my days were filled with carousels  
Fairground rides and cockleshells  
Kicking pebbles on a beach  
When time couldn't reach me  
And tears were just a memory left to be learned  
  
Now days catch me without an overcoat  
Five o'clock shoes full of snow  
All rained out, nowhere to go  
  
Memories are sure to find you  
No matter how fast you run  
Gonna catch up with you  
  
Charlie brown says  
Oh this winter sure sure gets me down  
When there ain't no friends around

Where the sun doesn't shine at all  
And I went looking for something for me  
But I came back with nothing at all  
Except an old man who could not see  
But he said that he knew God  
In Chelsea Walk  
On Chelsea Walk  
  
Now I've been down to Chelsea Walk  
Where the sun just refuses to shine  
And I ran back to my little room  
And I jumped straight into a bottle of wine  
You know I'll be alright for just a day  
But tomorrow I must wake  
In Chelsea Walk  
On Chelsea Walk  
  
Old man I must be on my way  
Don't you worry I'm just scared for those who pray

"Lay down your head  
And look to your window  
Where do you go  
When it's not where you're going?  
And how do you see  
When the light isn't shining?  
Where you could be  
If you worked out the timing  
  
And how does it feel when the world comes on so real and true?  
And how do you do the things you do to you?  
  
If I were a king  
And you were a lady  
What would I sing  
To say what I'm saying?  
And would you believe  
The verses left open?  
The heart on my sleeve  
The rhyming all broken  
  
And how does it feel when the world comes on so real and true?  
And how do you do the things you do to you?  
  
Sell me a river  
And I'll skate away  
To the downstream  
Where I did play  
So easy minded  
Like a hill on the skyline  
Tripped up and blinded  
Getting lost on the sidelines  
  
And how does it feel when the world comes on so real and true?  
And how do you do the things you do to you?  
And how do you do the things you do to you?

You leave me with the rest of you

Just before you go  
The more that I've been close with you  
The door was always closed

Drive away, but drive us anyway  
Get on up and straight you go  
There's nothing left to say  
And begging not's my place you know  
You'll never hear it anyway

I saw it made you blind  
There's more than I can really say  
Why it is it traps you all inside

You made it all get so uptight  
I made it in the dreams  
You went and robbed an overnight  
And they hid behind your scream  
They've hidden where I just don't know  
I think you've gone inside  
I hope the world looks good from there  
But I hope it looks alright  
We never made it all the way  
We never made it all the way  
You take the best of you  
I'll keep the rest of you

Better to let her know not to forget

Fall you to your knees  
Then give back nothing  
But looking through love  
You know there's something... so real

I could always lull myself to sleep  
But I will cry to let you always know  
All my life I need your time to grow

Scream down the wind

And houses like sweet confectionery  
And sandcastles and drinking wine  
Hungry dinners perfectly timed  
  
And mother and father glowing young  
Happy to be each other together  
When she blows the candle out  
She goes to bed and lies and drags through her head  
The day that went way of every day  
But tomorrow she'll fly a plane  
Over the fields where the houses aren't built yet

Through the lunch time smoke  
And I loved her for a second  
And discarded the queen and I know  
How sweetness turns sour  
And leaves they turn to brown  
And then to earth and dust  
And settle in this town  
You get blown away...

And who is dusting down the stars and giving me the wrong moves to make

Dancing upon the floor, its my shadow  
Making eyes until the sun blinds the daytime as she comes

Oh, into my day

Falling in the rain  
Lightening up the sun

Are here again

Worse than any other  
  
If I bought you flowers would you watch them grow  
Spring time is for certain to follow on the snow  
And if I could hold you where would you belong  
Sitting here to reason how the world's gone wrong  
  
Oh you've got it bad  
But you never should expect cover  
Oh you've got it so so bad  
Worse than any other
