All I have is a song  
  
I keep thinkin' about the friends I've had  
And all the meories we've shared  
They keep comin' back, time and time again  
Sometimes I wonder was it worth the cost  
And all I've lost

I'll be standin' at your door following along  
'Cause all I have is a song  
And this song will live on  
  
All I have is a song  
A piece of me to live on

"Somewhere south of winslow the road went right and I went left  
Nothin' out my window but desert, dirt, and death  
From outta nowhere stood an angel from up in the air  
Sometimes that hot horizon plays tricks on you I swear  
  
Oh, I picked her up  
  
Sure enough that girl was real, sittin' in my truck  
Said I know a place called the broken wheel where we can try our luck  
Five miles north of 66, behind old man lester's barn  
Where the whisky flows and the money goes and the sheriff claims that he don't
know  
  
Oh, here I go again, singin'  
  
Bang bang  
That cell door's closin' in  
Bang bang  
Here I go again  
Bang bang  
Those chains around my legs  
Bang bang  
This is where the highway ends  
  
4 am I was outta cash when she whispered in my ear  
I got a gun and a plan, pull the truck up to the rear  
Yeah it hit me like a tire tool right between the eyes  
When the door flew open, she came out screamin'  
Drive fool drive!  
  
Oh, here I go again singin'

"I've got a sayin' in my life that's got me by so far  
Well it mat not be right but, nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong  
The first mistake is leave it up to somebody else  
If you want somethin' done you got to do it yourself  
I'll do it myself before somebody makes a fool out of me  
  
[Chorus]  
'cause nothin' comes easy for a man like me  
Everybody thinks the best things in life are free  
If they would open their eyes it'd be so plain to see  
That the best things in life don't come so easily  
  
I met a man who thought just a little bit different from me  
He said you got it so easy but I just had to disagree  
It would have been alright but he pushed me too far  
If your lookin' for trouble step outside of this bar  
If it comes down to fistin', mister that ain't nothin' new to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You'll find in this life if there's somethin' that you believe  
You got to get your hands dirty when it's somethin' that you really need  
If they ever give you somethin' too easily  
Can't be too good, 'cause nothin' good's for free  
Tell ya' straight from the heart a bed of roses it will never be

"I'd like to tell y'all a story  
About a friend of mine  
Who liked to drink good whiskey, oh Lord  
And have a real good time  
His woman, you know she left him  
And stole that boy's brand new car  
And ran out of town with a guitar picker  
Said he gonna be a superstar  
Sure you are  
  
[Chorus:]  
You can't always trust your woman  
You can't always trust your best friend  
Beware of the ones that you need y'all  
'Cause those might be the ones that do you in  
  
Don't talk no stuff to no slicker  
Don't tell your feelings to your friend  
Don't tell your woman that you love her, because  
That's when your trouble begins  
There are many ladies here among us  
That'll stab you in the back when you ain't around  
There are many, so many of your very best friends  
That'll kick you in the head when you are down  
Yes they will  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't you backtalk the police  
'Cause its his job to put you in the jail  
They'll lock you up, boy and throw away the key  
And your best friend won't even go your bail  
There are many slickers here among us  
That are all dressed up in suits and ties  
But don't you show your pain, Lord in front of them  
'Cause if you do you kiss yourself goodbye, alright

"Way down yonder you can hear the wind blow  
Through the tall grass growing in the old bayou  
The old bayou  
  
There's a dark haired woman that looks so fine  
Wearing hand me down clothes, drinking homemade wine  
No one ever knew who her daddy was  
The people down here say it's all because  
She's the daughter of the devil, the sister of a snake  
The keeper of souls down on Voodoo Lake  
  
There's a city boy across the county line  
Came looking for the legend of the girl so fine  
Well the stories that he heard, well they had to be lies  
But he found out different when he looked in her eyes  
Well he tried to run away but she had control  
He's findin' out now what everybody knows  
He knew it was over when she started to shake  
Now there's one more soul down on Voodoo Lake  
  
There's an eerie silence at the break of dawn  
A chill in the air, something wrong  
When a shadow crosses the ground  
Those long lost souls never make a sound  
You'd think by now they'd realize  
She'll never break her bayou ties  
  
She's the daughter of the devil, the sister of a snake  
The keeper of souls down on Voodoo Lake

Coming home to your love, mama

I miss old friends that I once had  
Times ain't changed and I'll be glad when I go home  
I don't know why the thought came to me  
But why I'm here I really can't see, and now  
  
I want to come home. it's been so long since I've been away  
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried

Down to the crossroads  
Fell down on my knees

Everybody passed me by  
Take a ride  
  
Going down toward Rosedale  
Took Loretta by my side  
Going down to Rosedale  
Took Loretta by my side  
Can still buy a house there  
On the riverside

You can run, you can run  
Tell all my friends I'll be by  
You can run, you can run  
Tell my friends I'll be by  
And I'll be stayin' in the crossroads  
I believe I'm sinkin' down

"Well, there's a devil in the bottle, staring straight at me  
Daring me to reach out, but I know he's testing me  
If I take just one sip, I become that devil's son  
Act a fool, sell my soul before God and everyone  
Oh Lord, I know, I only hurt the ones I love  
  
I'm walkin' down this dead end road, all alone and by myself  
Wish I could blame the whiskey, but I can only blame myself  
Running out of chances, and Lord that's such a crime  
I got to find the answer before I lose my mind  
Oh Lord its a cryin' shame, oh Lord I've caused so much pain  
I only hurt the ones I love  
  
There's a devil in a bottle that just won't let me be  
So many times I've been hurtin' my soul and family  
But I got free on the day I fought the  
Devil in the bottle  
  
The next time that ol' devil tries to get the best of me  
I'll smash that bottle against the wall and know I'm finally free  
There's a devil in a bottle that just won't let me be  
There's so many times I let him hurt me

Makes me feel like you wouldn't care but

"There's a rumor goin' 'round on the backside of town  
Jake is out to get some revenge  
Has fire in his eyes since his brother died  
Shot down by a so-called friend  
  
For a fifty dollar gram is what the neighbors say  
Drugs had control of his life  
Caught up on crack you're tryin' to think back  
The devil had him hooked you could see it in his eyes  
It's a killer  
  
There's a cold house at the corner of the street  
The kids come and go there at night  
Jerry drove up in front of the house  
Somebody pulled out a knife  
Jerry freaked out and went for his gun  
Shot him right between the eyes  
All he ever wanted was a twenty dollar high  
But now he's locked up for the rest of his life

It's a killer there's no way out baby once your in  
It's a killer steal from your family

So don't you never, never give in  
It's a killer  
  
The neighborhood I used to call home  
These days it's lookin' like a war zone  
Unemployment on the rise but the black market thrives  
Money just keeps changin' hands  
The laws are gettin' tough sometimes it's not enough  
To satisfy supply and demand  
  
Trouble breaks out there's fightin' in the streets  
Bullets flyin' all around  
An innocent child caught in the line of fire  
All because there weren't enough drugs to go around

"This song goes out to all the money men  
  
He drives around in a fancy car  
Smokes those long Cuban cigars  
He don't know how to play guitar  
He can't sing but still the pretty girls think he's a star  
  
We play music got families to feed  
Ain't good with numbers and he knows we can't read  
If we get a dollar you know he gets three  
It ain't hard to figure out it's as simple as can be  
Don't ask me ask the money man  
  
These boys are livin' in a fantasy land  
I just keep 'em on the road so they can pay the money man  
I'll be long gone before they understand  
My promises are strong like a road made out of sand  
  
I wanna be your money man  
My mortgage is picked up by the band  
I wanna be your money man  
The boys, oh they're sleepin' out in the van  
  
Don't ask me ask the money man  
You boys are livin' in fantasy land  
You signed the dotted line I'm takin' all I can  
Your money's lookin' good in my retirement plan  
That's just the way it is when your playin' in a band  
  
That's my money man down on his knees  
He ain't prayin' but he damn sure ought to be  
He's at a place where money doesn't grow on trees  
And all his prison buddies doin' more than shoot the breeze  
How does it feel no money man  
Not too good  
What did you do with my money man  
Well I a, well a you know a,  
How does it feel to be a honey man  
Are you sure that your still a man  
  
Aw your dressed up like a little girl  
Just shootin' the breeze down on your knees  
Money man, oh money man

He knows when you're a wake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree  
So! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play  
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day  
You'd better write your letter now  
And mail it right away  
Because he's getting ready  
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo

Come sit beside me, my only son  
And listen closely to what I say.

It will help you some sunny day.

Troubles will come and they will pass.  
Go find a woman and you'll find love,  
And don't forget son,  
There is someone up above.

All that you need is in your soul,  
And you can do this if you try.  
All that I want for you my son,  
Is to be satisfied.

All you pretty women lord, I hope you understand  
Don't be a fool lord no, and put your heart in a travelin' man  
  
I'm a travelin' man  
Travelin' man  
Travelin' man, that's what I am  
Travelin' man  
  
Travelin' man, that's what I am  
Guess Ill always be  
Travelin' man, that's what I am  
But at least I'm free  
  
Travelin' man  
Oh, that's what I am  
  
Travelin' man, that's what I am, lord I move so fast  
I have had so many women, none of them have last  
I am just a mover, moving fast as sound  
Always free, sometimes lonely. always movin around  
Travelin' man  
Travelin' man, that's what I am  
Travelin' man  
Oh, that's what I am

"This is a story 'bout livin'  
A tale of a long hard road  
Ain't a whole lot of misgivin's  
Of the things that I thought I sowed  
My daddy was a real hard worker  
He said son there will come a day  
Talk ain't always cheap  
And here's what daddy had to say  
With these hands I've made my livin'  
With these hands I've held a child  
With these hands I've climbed a mountain  
Sometimes we forget  
We ain't much different at all  
  
He likes grits, you like the apple  
There ain't nothin' wrong with that  
He says y'all, you say you's  
It all depends on where you're at  
Well a little bit of music is a whole lot of fun  
And its always good for the soul  
From New York City out to California  
You know its only rock and roll  
  
With these hands we come together  
With these hands we can change the world  
With these hands I play my music  
Sometimes we forget  
We ain't much different at all  
  
Oh, not at all  
So what I'm trying to tell you  
Is that I'm only one son of the south  
Its gonna take more than you me and you  
To work this whole thing out  
  
With these hands I've made my livin'  
With these hands I've held a child  
With these hands I've climbed a mountain  
Sometimes we forget  
  
With these hands we come together  
With these hands we can change the world  
With these hands I play my music  
Sometimes we forget  
We ain't much different  
We ain't much different  
Ain't much different  
At all

"Well, its eight o'clock in Boise, Idaho  
I'll find my limo driver  
Mister, take us to the show  
I done made some plans for later on tonight  
I'll find a little queen  
And I know I can treat her right.  
  
[Chorus:]  
What's your name, little girl?  
What's your name?  
Shootin' you straight, little girl?  
Won't you do the same?  
  
Back at the hotel  
Lord we got such a mess  
It seems that one of the crew  
Had a go with one of the guests, oh yes  
Well, the police said we can't drink in the bar  
What a shame  
Won't you come upstairs girl  
And have a drink of champagne  
  
What's your name, little girl?  
What's your name?  
Shootin' you straight, little girl?  
For there ain't no shame.  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Nine o'clock the next day  
And I'm ready to go  
I got six hundred miles to ride  
To do one more show, oh no  
Can I get you a taxi home  
It sure was grand  
When I come back here next year  
I want to see you again  
  
What was your name, little girl?  
What's your name?  
Shootin' you straight, little girl?  
Well there ain't no shame  
What was your name, little girl?  
What's your name?  
Shootin' you straight, little girl?  
Won't you do the same?

"One, two, three, two, two, three  
  
White dove sittin' on a blackberry bush  
Is there any questioning why  
Tell me what heaven you're bound for today  
Feel just like I could cry  
Feel just like I could cry  
  
Little squirrel sitting on a flat slanted rock  
Wondering where the winter meal is coming from  
Tired of fighting for it, gonna lay down my gun  
Just know that my work is done  
Just know that my work is done  
  
Little boy blue now come blow your horn  
No more of the sheep is around  
Said I'm tired of fighting, gonna lay down my gun  
Just know that my work is done  
Just know that my work is done  
Just know that my work is done  
Just know that my work is done

"Up every mornin' before the sun  
Takin' my lovin' on the run  
Breakin' my back till the day is done  
I'm gonna punch that time clock and have some fun  
Ain't no easy way to get myself out  
  
So-I keep on workin'  
Like a workin' man do  
I gotta buy my baby shoes  
I keep on workin'  
It's the only thing to do  
I make my livin by the sweat of my brow  
Oh-workin' just like you-uh  
  
I was raised on the poor side of town  
I made my livin' movin' around  
I never let no one dog me down  
Oh I was taught to stand my ground  
Life was always changin'  
That's just the way it is  
  
So-I keep on workin'  
Like a workin' man do  
I got to buy my baby shoes  
I keep on workin'  
It's the only thing to do  
I make my livin by the sweat of my brow

Oh-I keep on workin'  
Like a workin' man do  
I need to buy my baby shoes

"Seven years of hard luck, comin' down on me  
From the Florida border, yeah up to Nashville, Tennessee  
I worked in every joint you can name, mister every honky tonk  
Along come Mr. Yankee Slicker, sayin' maybe you're what I want  
  
[Chorus]  
Want you to sign your contract  
Want you to sign today  
Gonna give you lots of money  
Workin' For MCA  
  
Nine thousand dollars, that's all we could win  
But we smiled at the Yankee Slicker with a big ol' Southern grin  
They're gonna take me out to California,  
Gonna make me a superstar  
Just pay me all of my money  
And mister maybe you won't get a scar  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Suckers took my money since I was seventeen  
If it ain't no pencil pusher, it got to be a honky tonk queen  
But I'll sign my contract baby, and I want you people to know  
That every penny that I make, I'm gonna see where my money goes  
  
[Chorus]
