Watching as she innocently plays.

Because I'm always wearing shades.  
She feeds the ducks, looks at the flowers.  
I follow her around for hours and hours.  
I'd take her home, but that could never be,  
She's just a substitute  
For what's been taken from me.

I just want to stay the way that I am.

Cure all diseases, conquer pain  
And monitor the human brain,  
And see what thoughts you're thinking.  
Observe your feelings,  
Secret fears,  
Controlling everything you say and do  
And we will build a master race  
To live within our artificial world.  
Tell it to the people all across the land,  
We're going to build an artificial man  
With the physique of a Tarzan  
And the profile of a Cary Grant,

Totally made by hand.

Mould you section by section,

When the world will be controlled by artificial people,

Made a man that's totally programmed,  
Preconditioned thoughts and emotions,

Well here's your chance to be a total automaton

Make your hair grow longer if you need it.

And organise your life and keep it totally planned.

It didn't matter in the artificial light,

She had nothing to hide, she put it all out to show.  
She didn't cover up or try to conceal,  
I knew the way that she felt 'cause her expression was real.  
She didn't cover up the inside,  
She showed it all on the outside,  
Stark naked in the artificial light.

To be yourself you have to put on an act.  
Get together in the artificial light.  
  
And if I saw her in the light of day,  
I wouldn't know what to say, I wouldn't know what had happened.  
I only want to know a world below,  
Where we can be ourselves beneath an artificial glow.

"In a deep dark jungle long time ago  
Lived a lonesome caveman  
He was a solitary soul  
And he spent his playtime  
Chewing meat from bones.  
He didn't know how to talk much  
He only knew how to groan  
Then he lifted up his hands and reached to the sky  
Let out a yell and no one replied.  
Frustration and torment tore him inside  
Then he fell to the ground and he cried and he cried.  
But then education saved the day.  
He learned to speak and communicate  
Education saved the day.  
He thanked God for the friends he made.  
Cause everybody needs an education  
Everybody needs an education.  
Black skin, red skin, yellow or white,  
Everybody needs to read and write  
Everybody needs an education.  
  
Thank the day when that primitive man  
Learned to talk with his brothers  
And live off the land.  
He left his cave and he moved far away  
And he lived with his friends in a house that they'd made  
He learned to think and to work with his brain  
And he astounded his friends with all the knowledge he gained  
  
He wrote it down on a rock that he found  
And he showed all his friends and they passed it around  
And then education came that day.  
The day it came was a sacred day.  
Education came that day  
He thanked God for the friends he'd made.

"Holiday,  
Oh what a lovely day today,  
I'm so glad they sent me away,  
To have a little holiday today, holiday,  
Holiday,  
And I'm just standing on the end of a pier,  
Hoping and dreaming you were here,  
To share my little holiday,  
  
Lookin' in the sky, for a gap in the clouds,  
Sometimes I think that sun ain't never coming out,  
But I'd rather be here than in that dirty old town,  
I had to leave the city 'cause it broke me down,  
  
Oh holiday, oh what a lovely day today,  
I think I'll get down on my little knees and pray, thank you Lord,  
Thank heaven for this holiday, holiday,  
I'm leaving insecurity behind me,  
The environmental pressures got me down,  
I don't need no sedatives to pull me round,  
I don't need no sleeping pills to help me sleep sound,  
  
Oh holiday,  
Oh what a lovely day today,  
I think I'll get down on my knees and pray,  
That's what I'll do,  
Thank heaven for this holiday,  
  
Lying on the beach with my back burned rare,  
And the salt gets in my blisters and the sand gets in my hair,  
And the sea's an open sewer,  
But I really couldn't care,  
I'm breathing through my mouth so I don't have to sniff the air,  
  
Oh holiday,  
Oh what a lovely day today,  
I'm so glad they sent me away,  
To have a little holiday.

"I won a competition in a little column in my local paper.  
So I packed my bags and flew across the sea all on my local paper.  
Sailing to Hawaii in the U.S.A.  
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.  
  
I didn't realize it was commercialized when I unpacked my cases,  
Because a genuine Hawaii ukulele cost me 30 guineas,  
And even when I'm swimming I have to pay.  
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.  
Oh yeah, yeah.  
  
Across the coral sands I saw a hula hula dancer, looking pretty.  
I asked her where she came from and she said to me,  
""I come from New York City,  
And my mother is Italian,  
And my dad's a Greek.""  
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.  
  
It's a hooka hooka on the shiny briny on the way to Kona,  
And in a little shack they had a little sign that said Coca Cola,  
And even all the grass skirts were PVC.

He just sits in the gloom of his dimly-lit room  
Waiting for them to swallow the bait.  
  
While the rich run their rackets he sits in his attic  
And casually clocks their defeat.  
While the politicians cover up mistakes that they've made  
And all the promises, the lies and deceits.

"Come on love  
Let's forget about all the things that we've done wrong  
Just remember all of the things that we've done right  
I'm in no mood to argue and I'm in no mood to fight  
So let the tears pass you by  
Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry  
And I ain't gonna let this big world get me down  
I gotta learn to keep a hold of my head and keep my feet on the ground  
Moments of ecstatic happiness  
And the moments of stress that we had better forget  
But love, I gotta feeling that I've said it all before  
I said it before  
I say I'll never do you wrong but then I go and do the same again  
I don't know why, don't know why  
Don't know why, don't know why, don't know why  
We gotta learn to share these moments in our lives  
And never let it get us down, we gotta put up a fight  
Moments to remember all our lives  
From the first brief hello to the last good-bye  
I say I'll never do you wrong but then I go and do the same again  
I don't know why, don't know why  
Don't know why, don't know why, don't know why

"Show me a man who says he can live without bread  
And I'll show you a man who's a liar and in debt.  
There's no one alive who can't be purchased or enticed  
There's no man alive who wouldn't sell for a price,  
Money talks and we're the living proof,  
There ain't no limit to what money can do  
Money talks, money talks.  
  
Money can't breathe and money can't see,  
But when I pull out a fiver people listen to me.  
Money can't run and money can't walk,  
But when I write out a check I swear to God I hear money talk.  
Money talks and, baby, when you've been bought  
You pay attention every time money talks.  
Money talks, money talks.  
  
Money talks and there's no doubt about it  
Money talks and we can't live without it,  
What's the point of living unless you've got money?  
I just couldn't function without money.  
Money talks, money talks,  
Money talks, money talks.  
  
Show me an upright respected man  
And I'll have him licking my boots when I put money in his hand.  
It rots your heart, it gets to your soul,  
Before you know where you are you're a slave to the green gold.  
Money talks and we're the living proof  
There ain't no limit to what money can do.  
Money talks you out of your self-respect,  
The more you crave it the cheaper you get.  
Money talks, money talks.  
  
Money buys you time and people listen,  
Money can buy a smile and make life worth living.  
If you're ugly money can improve you.  
I just couldn't face the world without mazuma.  
Money talks, money talks

"Here is a story about a sinner,  
He used to be a winner who enjoyed a life of prominence and position,  
But the pressures at the office and his socialite engagements,  
And his selfish wife's fanatical ambition,  
It turned him to the booze,  
And he got mixed up with a floosie  
And she led him to a life of indecision.  
The floosie made him spend his dole  
She left him lying on Skid Row  
A drunken lag in some Salvation Army Mission.  
It's such a shame.

Who thought I would say,  
Damn it all and blow it all,

Barley wine pink gin,  
He'll drink anything,  
Port, Pernod or tequila,  
Rum, scotch, vodka on the rocks,  
As long as all his troubles disappeared.  
But he messed up his life and he beat up his wife,  
And the floosie's gone and found another sucker  
She's gonna turn him on to drink  
She's gonna lead him to the brink  
And when his money's gone,  
She'll leave him in the gutter,  
It's such a shame.

"My big day, it was the biggest day of my life.  
It was the summit of my long career,  
But I felt so down, and I drank too much beer,  
And my manager said that I should not appear.  
I walked out onto the stage and started to speak.  
The first night I've missed for a couple of years,  
I explained to the crowed and they started to jeer,  
And just when I wanted no one to be there,  
All of my friends were there.  
Not just my friends, but their best friends too.  
All of my friends were there to stand and stare,  
Say what they may, all of their friends need not stay.  
Those who laughed were not friends anyway.  
All of my friends were there to stand and stare.  
  
Days went by, I walked around dressed in a disguise.  
I wore a mustache and I parted my hair,  
And gave the impression that I did not care,  
But oh, the embarrassment, oh, the despair.  
Came the day, helped with a few last glasses of gin,  
I nervously mounted the stage once again,  
Got through my performance and no one complained,  
Thank God I can go back to normal again.  
I went to that old cafe,  
Where I had been in much happier days,  
And all of my friends were there,

"Well I woke this morning with a pain in my neck,  
A pain in my heart and a pain in my chest,  
I went to the good doctor and the good doctor said,  
You gotta slow down your life or you're gonna be dead,  
Cut out the struggle and strife,  
It only complicates your life.  
  
Well I cut down women I cut out booze,  
I stopped ironing my shirts, cleaning my shoes,  
I stopped going to work, reading the news,  
I'm sitting twiddling my thumbs 'cause I got nothing to do,  
Minimal exercise,  
To help uncomplicate my life,  
Gotta stand and face it life is so complicated,  
Ladi dah di dahdah, ladi dah di dah dah,  
Got to get away from the complicated life son,  
Life is overated, life is complicated,  
Must alleviate this, complicated life.  
  
Like old Mother Hubbard  
I got nothin' in the cupboard,  
Got no dinner and I got no supper,  
Holes in my shoes I got holes in my socks,  
I can't go to work 'cause I can't get a job,  
The bills are rising sky high,  
It's such a complicated life,  
Gotta stand and face it,  
Life is so complicated.

"Some people say that life is a game, well if this is so  
I'd like to know the rules on which this game of life is based.  
I know of no game more fitting than the age old game of cricket  
It has honor, it has character and it's British.  
Now God laid down the rules of life when he wrote those Ten Commandments  
And to cricket those ten same rules shall apply.  
Show compassion and self-righteousness and be honest above all  
And come to God's call with bat and ball.  
  
Now the Devil has a player and he's called the Demon Bowler,  
He's shrewd, he's rude and he's wicked.  
He is sent by Sinful Satan and he's out to take your wicket  
And you know that that's not cricket.  
He'll baffle you with googlies with leg breaks and off spin  
But keep a level head and don't let that demon in.  
So keep a straight bat at all times, let the Bible be your guide  
And you'll get by, yes you'll get by.  
  
All through your life he'll try to bowl you out  
Beware the Demon bowler.  
He's crafty and deceitful and he'll try to L.B.W.,  
And bowl a maiden over.  
The Devil takes the weak in spirit and so we must always be courageous  
And remember that God is on your side.  
So keep old Satan in your sights and play the straight and narrow line  
And you'll get by, yes you'll get by.

Daylight over the hills and valleys heralding the morning.  
Daylight over the mountains, daylight on the Village Green,  
Daylight over the field and the factories.  
Another night has gone away and here comes yet another day.  
  
See the early morning risers walking round with bleary eyes.  
Worn out housewives grit their teeth ignoring new born babies' cries.  
Look at all the busy people this way, that way, everywhere  
Biting toast and swallowing tea and breakfast specials on the air.  
Feel that daylight.  
  
Feel the sunlight on my pillow and it stops my yawing.  
I thank God that I'm still around to see another dawn in.  
Daylight over the valleys, daylight lighting up the trees,  
Daylight over the hillside,  
Smile a smile and sing a song, another night has been and gone.  
  
Middle-aged bankers crack their backs and wish they were young and in their
teens,  
Lonely spinsters dream of dating Roger Moore or Steve McQueen.  
Health fanatics in their attics training for the Empire Games,  
School boys dream of Captain Scarlet, battle ships and aeroplanes.

"Drift away, just drift away  
Sometimes I wish I could just drift away  
They say there's gonna be a river of blood  
It's apocalypse now  
  
So we're waiting for the flood  
The ice is gonna melt, the water gonna rise  
And we'll all go to hell  
So they're keeping us advised  
  
While the dollar falls down  
The yen gonna climb  
It's a moral decline  
And I'm losing my mind  
  
I think I'll just drift away  
To that island of my dreams  
Live in total fantasy  
Close my eyes and drift away  
  
Back in the real world  
There's tension everywhere  
And the smell of fear  
Keeps hanging around and polluting the air  
  
The man on the news is going over the top  
Now he'll say anything so his show don't flop  
Wall street's down, so what  
And according to astute market analysis  
  
The world's gonna stop  
They shout the story to the nation  
Pass on the panic to the population  
This is the end of civilization  
It's all over now  
  
[Chorus]  
Meanwhile, I just drift away  
To my island in the sun  
Imaginary paradise, perfection  
Sometimes I wish I could just drift away  
Drift away (drift away)  
Drift away (drift away)  
Drift away (drift away)  
  
Now all the politicians are running out of hope  
They've burned all their bridges  
Now they just can't cope  
And who do we blame now we're all going broke?  
It's that man over there  
Who's hanging from a rope  
Newsmen winding up the nation  
A little bad news helps circulation  
Pass on the panic to the population  
It's all over, it's all over  
It's all over now  
  
Times like this, I just drift away  
To my tropical fantasy  
Living on coconuts growing on the trees  
Sometimes I wish I could just drift away  
Drift away, drift away, drift away  
It's apocalypse now, drift away  
Rivers of blood, drift away  
And the man on the news is going over the top

"Hey, hey, hey...  
Give the people what they want  
  
Well, it's been said before, the world is a stage  
A different performance with every age.  
Open the history book to any old page  
Bring on the lions and open the cage.  
  
Give the people what they want  
You gotta give the people what they want  
The more they get, the more they need  
And every time they get harder and harder to please  
  
The Roman promoters really did things right.  
They needed a show that would clearly excite.  
The attendance was sparse so they put on a fight  
Threw the Christians to the lions, sold out every night  
  
Give the people what they want  
You gotta give the people what they want  
The more they get, the more they need  
And every time they get harder and harder to please  
  
Give 'em lots of sex, perversion and rape  
Give 'em lots of violence, and plenty to hate  
Give the people what they want  
Give the people what they want

We all sit glued while the killer takes aim

You've let them down after all of these years.  
Sacrificed all, now there's nothing to show,  
Ungrateful youth, decided you're going solo.

Turn a new leaf and start all over again

You're a lot like me, that's why I'm still your friend  
Still no offence, no more hard feelings left on silly sentiment  
No harm was ever felt or ever meant  
You go your way, I'm bound to see you on the street again some day  
And when I do I'll always say

"Living in a world where the flesh is cheap.  
Body touches body but it's only skin deep.  
I can hold you in my arms every time that you weep  
But we've lost that emotional flow.

With maximum exposure full of sleaziness

Trying, trying my heart is reaching out to you  
How do I get close to you?

Get close to the homeless wasters and the innocent  
Get close to the souls ignored and forgotten by the  
Establishment.  
People get afraid to touch in case it rubs off on them  
Gotta get close, yeah people gotta stay close, close.  
People gotta stay close.

This world is full of barriers that keep us apart.  
Keep it superficial before feelings can start

Act normal there's nothing wrong  
Stay cool, just carry on  
  
You gotta live life and be yourself  
You can't live life for anyone else  
You gotta live life that's all you do  
Nobody gonna live your life for you  
  
Don't get depressed when you read in the press  
About world revolution and social unrest  
Try not to panic when you switch on the news  
And see crooked politicians and the unemployment queues  
It's only life it's really fine  
So don't you believe all you read in the headlines  
Live life see it through  
Carry on it's all you can do  
  
You gotta live life for yourself, can't live for anyone else  
You gotta live life, that's all you do  
Nobody gonna live their life for you  
  
Extra verse from long version  
Trendy intellectuals always take action  
For every cause that's ever been in fashion  
Weekend revolutionaries protest and sing  
Because they're dedicated followers of any old thing  
They got every solution for every revolution  
They live in the slums just like the poor people do  
But they'd rather sniff coke instead of glue  
Right-wing fascists beat up the blacks  
Then they salute the Union Jack  
You can't pretent there's nothing wrong  
It's not the end, so just carry on  
  
Oh, life's a mother, oh, life's a mother  
Oh, life's a mother, oh, life's a mother  
  
You gotta live life for yourself, can't live life for anyone else  
You gotta live life

"Spent last winter playing in the sand  
With the prisoners of the motherland  
Damn hotel is feeling like a cell  
  
And even paradise can be so cruel  
Sitting by the swimming pool  
Trying to keep my head together  
In that hot Australia weather  
  
Three days to kill and my per diem's getting low  
Cause I spent all my money calling long distance  
Calling long distance, such a long way from home  
  
Am I talking to long distance, can you put me through?  
Twelve thousand miles but I've got not resistance,  
Long distance, long distance, long distance, long distance  
  
Now the Road Hog's face is turning red  
Larry's still asleep in bed  
Romeo he can't get no head at all  
And the Doctor looks on so annoyed  
You disappoint me, Mr. Boyd  
And the Electric Dwarf wishes he was six foot tall  
  
Now Romeo's patience is wearing thin  
C'mon baby, let me in  
It's five a.m. and I've been creeping 'round the hall  
Got no resistance calling long distance  
You sound so close but your such a long way from home  
  
Am I talking to long distance, can you put me through?  
Twelve thousand miles but I've got not resistance,  
Long distance, long distance, long distance, long distance  
  
Still no points for my merrymen,  
Except Ricard, he just scored ten  
Now Road Hog's getting drunk again  
And I only get to hold my pen  
Instead of what I love to hold the most.  
  
I feel so lonesome I could cry  
Count the hours as they roll by  
It's day time now  
I think I'll make a call  
  
Hello long distance, calling long distance  
You sound so close but you're such a long way from home  
You're such a long way from home

Nobody listens and no one will understand.  
Yet I'm wondering, sitting here wondering,  
And listening to both sides.  
Why can't we work it out?  
Why can't we sort it out?  
We'll work it out if we try.  
Why can't we sit down and work out a compromise,  
Why not negotiate and try to be civilized?  
I'll tell you why, because nobody gives a damn.  
Nobody listens and no one will understand.  
Yet, I'm wondering, sitting here wondering,  
Yet I'm wondering, sitting here wondering  
Listening to both sides.  
Nobody gives, nobody gives, nobody gives.  
The workers told the unions who blamed it on the government,  
The politicians blamed it on the strikers and the militants,  
Everybody's guilty and everybody's innocent.  
Nobody gives. Nobody gives a damn any more.  
The politicians, unions, workers and the militants,  
The fact of it is nobody gives any more.

"Scene: flash is on the run and he goes to belle for help.  
He sings this song with belle.  
  
Flash: when we were young and green  
We shared our dreams together,  
And you were my friend.  
  
Belle: we had our good times pal,  
We thought they'd last forever.  
But nothing lasts forever,  
Nothing lasts forever.  
Time goes by and people change  
It's best we go our separate ways  
And it was wrong to think our love would never end  
My friend  
Nothing lasts forever,  
Nothing lasts forever.  
Time goes by it takes us all,  
Nations crumble and empires fall  
And who are we  
To think that we would always be,  
You see nothing lasts forever,  
Nothing lasts forever.  
  
Flash: I know that you'll survive  
And you'll get by whatever.  
Though you say goodbye.  
My love will never die,  
It will last forever.  
  
Your love will die but mine will last forever,  
Your love will fade but mine will last forever.  
Your feeling might go but mine will last forever.  
And though you're gone you're in my mind forever.

"Remember walking with you by my side  
You were my papa and I was your pride  
Now I've got children and I'm going grey  
No time for talking I got nothin' to say  
Those Sunday dinners that we had at home  
Now I've got a house and I've got friends of my own  
We can't do tomorrow what we did yesterday  
It's best that we're going our separate ways, ok  
How is your rheumatism (nothing to say)  
How are your chillblains (nothing to say)  
How's Aunty Mabel (nothing to say)  
So far papa, I got nothin' to say, ok  
Those happy days we spent together  
We thought our world would never change  
How the days go by  
And things will never be the same  
You keep pretending that everything's fine  
So you make small talk to help pass the time  
But all the words that you spit from your face  
Add up to nothin' you got nothin' to say  
How are those noisy neighbors next door  
I'll have to go soon ''cause I'm getting bored  
I gotta be home early to see a good play  
So far papa, I got nothin' to say  
How is your life insurance (nothing to say)  
How is your trade union (nothing to say)  
How is your independence (nothing to say)  
So for papa, I got nothin' to say

"In the beginning of it all there was the land  
And the sea and she sky  
Then into the middle of it all there came man  
To live on the land.  
  
And then a great nation  
Put into operation an evolutionary plan  
Now mighty corporations and politicians rule the land  
Wish I could remember when  
  
We were more innocent  
Than all of those violent bitter men.  
The world was much younger then  
But we were much wiser then.  
  
Before we were full of discontent.  
It's too bad the simple ways came sadly to an end  
I guess that's the difference between now and then.  
In the beginning of it all there was the land.  
  
We were much younger then  
But we were much wiser then  
We never questioned why or when  
One day we'll be born again  
  
Our lovers and friends will remain  
To live in a world without suffering and pain  
And I can see a day when enemies are friends.  
And there'll be no distance between now and then.  
In the beginning of it all there was the Land.

"In a world full of jive  
Full of homicide and suicide  
There's no room for love and romance  
In a world full of spite  
Full of hatefulness and bitterness  
Sincerity don't stand a chance  
And every night I close my eyes  
And ask the stars above  
Oh where, oh where, oh where, oh where is love?  
  
Where is love and romance  
And appreciation of storybooks, fairy tales  
And the ordinary things people did long ago  
Where did it go?  
Where is love?  
Where is hope?  
Where is sympathy and trust?  
Where is faith?  
Where is joy in simplicity?  
And where is regard and respect?  
Oh where, oh where is love?  
This world is spinning and turning  
And my head is full of learning  
But my thoughts keep on returning  
To the things I used to know  
I should be stronger  
But my mind continually wanders  
And deep inside  
A voice keeps crying  
Where, oh where is love?  
  
Where is love and romance  
And appreciation of storybooks, fairy tales,  
And the ordinary things people did long ago?  
Where did it go?  
In a world full of jive  
Full of homicide and suicide  
There's no room for love and romance  
In a world full of rape  
Full of hatefulness and bitterness  
Sincerity don't stand a chance  
And every night I close my eyes  
And ask the stars above  
Oh where, oh where, oh where, oh where is love?  
Where oh where is love?  
Where is love?  
Where is hope?  
Where is sympathy and trust?

"All life we work but work is bore,  
If life's for livin' what's livin' for,  
She lives in a house that's near decay,  
Built for the industrial revolution,  
  
But in her dreams she is far away,  
In Oklahoma U.S.A.  
With Shirley Jones and Gordon McRea,  
As she buys her paper at the corner shop,  
  
She's walkin' on the surrey with the fringe on top,  
'Cause in her dreams she is far away,  
In Oklahoma U.S.A.,  
She walks to work but she's still in a daze,  
  
She's Rita Hayworth or Doris Day,  
And Errol Flynn's gonna take her away,  
To Oklahoma U.S.A.,  
All life we work but work is a bore,  
If life's for livin' then what's livin' for.

"See Johnny Thunder sitting on his motorbike  
Riding along the highway,  
Rock and roll songs from the nineteen-fifties  
Buzzing around in his brain.  
Johnny Thunder he's one of the original bebop generation  
And he's got no time for complicated music  
Or too much sophistication.  
  
He's one of the survivors,  
The motorbike riders.  
You ought to see Johnny Thunder  
Riding down the highway  
One of the rock and roll survivors,  
Twelve bars flowing through his brain.  
He digs Jerry Lee Lewis, Dion and The Belmonts,  
And Johnny and The Hurricanes.  
  
He plays Hound Dog, Oh Boy,  
And Great Balls of Fire  
And Boppin' At The High School Hop.  
And he's got no time for phonies or posers  
Cause they don't know how to reel and rock.  
And he plays Little Egypt and Ooh Poo Pah Doo,  
And he plays Poison Ivy and Blue Suede Shoes,  
The Hollywood Argyles, Danny and The Juniors,  
Dion and The Belmonts, Johnny and The Hurricanes.  
  
He's one of the survivors,  
The boppers and the jivers,  
Yeah and he rocks all day.  
Johnny and The Hurricanes, Johnny and The Hurricanes.  
  
Got my freedom riding along the freeway.  
I ride a hundred miles an hour  
But I don't mess up my D.A.  
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll.  
You can't stop rock 'n' rollin' music play.  
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll.  
You can't stop rock 'n' rollin' music play.  
  
Feel those vibrations flow in my brain.  
Got my freedom riding down the highway,  
Keeps me sane, feel alive,  
I'm one of the survivors.  
  
Feel all right.  
First gear, second gear,  
Third gear, fourth gear, all right.  
Old Johnny Thunder looks a little overweight,  
And his sideburns are turning grey.  
But he still likes to bebop, boogie and jive  
To his worn out seventy-eights.  
Johnny Thunder.  
He's alright.  
He's one of the survivors,  
Twelve bars flowing through his brain,  
Jerry Lee Lewis, Dion and The Belmonts,  
Johnny and The Hurricanes,  
Johnny and The Hurricanes.

"Standing by the elevator  
Feeling gloomy and down  
Waiting for the flashing light  
To lift me up from the ground  
  
Then the elevator opened  
And I saw her standing there  
She had to be a young executive  
She looked so corporate and clean  
  
And I thought I'd seen her somewhere before  
On the cover of a magazine  
I didn't think she'd even look at me  
Or bother to glance my way  
  
But she actually smiled at me and said  
Hi-ya handsome, have a good day  
  
[Chorus]  
I must be dreaming if she looks at me  
I gotta be dreaming, is it a fantasy  
Now I've got positive emotions  
Buzzing 'round every molecule in me  
I gotta be dreaming, is it reality  
But over and over I live that memory  
Was it real or only a dream  
La la la la  
  
Was it my imagination playing tricks on me  
When she looked my way  
Maybe she took me for somebody else  
Whatever it was, it made my day, hey hey  
  
I wake up in the morning  
Smiling with anticipation  
Suddenly I feel alive  
Face the world with expectation  
  
I must be dreaming this world is a better place  
Was my imagination playing tricks on me  
Was it real or only a dream?  
I see a great big sunset  
  
Where only clouds used to be  
Was it all an illusion, is it fantasy  
If it's just a dream  
It's good enough for me, yeah yeah  
  
Waiting by the elevator  
Feeling optimistic and keen  
Waiting for my executive goddess  
To appear as if in a dream  
  
Then the elevator opened  
She was talking to another guy  
And I tried to say hello to her  
But I failed to even catch her eye  
  
Then everybody crowded inside  
And I sadly stood my ground  
Thinking life's just like that elevator  
It takes you up and brings you down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Was it only an illusion  
Was it real or only a dream  
  
[Chorus]
