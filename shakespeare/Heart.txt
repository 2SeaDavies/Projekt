"Hey hot shot boy  
Hand on your hip  
You're wasting your time  
Giving me lip  
When you look at me, it melts my legs  
And wraps me around your fingertip  
  
You don't have to say a word  
To get hold of me  
Take me, shake me  
Burning gravity baby  
Look at me  
Look at me  
  
[Chorus]  
You're all eyes, all eyes  
Touching me in the night  
You're all eyes - and those eyes  
Are tearing me up inside  
  
We go walking you and i  
If some woman turns your eye  
I pull you back in my direction  
Too keep you by my side  
  
You don't have to go nowhere  
To get where you should be  
You don't have to look around  
Just you look at me - look at me - look at me  
  
[Chorus: x 4]

"It was a rainy night when he came into sight  
Standing by the road, no umbrella, no coat  
So I pulled up along side and I offered him a ride  
He accepted with a smile so we drove for a while  
I didn't ask him his name, this lonely boy in the rain  
Fate tell me it's right, is this love at first sight  
Please don't make it wrong, just stay for the night  
All I want to do is make love to you  
Say you will you want me too  
All I want to do is make love to you  
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to  
  
So we found this hotel, it was a place I knew well  
We made magic that night. Oh, he did everything right  
He brought the woman out of me, so many times, easily  
And in the morning when he woke all I left him was a note  
I told him I am the flower you are the seed  
We walked in the garden we planted a tree  
Don't try to find me, please don't you dare  
Just live in my memory, you'll always be there  
  
All I want to do is make love to you  
One night of love was all we knew  
All want to do is make love to you  
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to  
  
Oh, oooh, we made love  
Love like strangers  
All night long  
We made love  
  
Then it happened one day, we came round the same way  
You can imagine his surprise when he saw his own eyes  
I said please, please understand  
I'm in love with another man  
And what he couldn't give me  
was the one little thing that you can  
  
All I want to do is make love to you  
One night of love was all we knew  
All I want to do is make love to you  
Come on, say you will, you want me too  
  
All I want to do is make love to you  
One night of love was all we knew  
All I want to do is make love to you  
Say you will, you want me too  
  
All night long...

"Forgive me I can't stay here anymore  
I'm leaving with the tide  
This evening another breeze blew 'round my door and stirred me up inside  
I'm breaking out of this tired old spell  
I played it out long and so well  
And the phoenix flies straight and high back to Avalon  
Now I'm on my way back where I belong  
  
Gonna go down with the sun  
Back to Avalon  
Where I'm going all my demons disappear  
I'm leaving them behind  
I'm travelling way up on the atmosphere  
'Cause I made up my mind  
Gonna find my love  
Gonna find my life  
Gonna look them so deep in the eye  
And the phoenix flies straight and high back to Avalon  
Now I'm on my way back where I belong  
  
Gonna go down with the sun  
Back to Avalon  
Nobody knows what's inside my head or down this road  
Oh I know I'm going home  
And the phoenix flies straight and high back to Avalon  
Now I'm on my way back where I belong  
  
Gonna go down with the sun  
And the phoenix flies straight and high back to Avalon  
Now I'm on my way back where I belong  
  
Gonna go down with the sun  
Back to Avalon

The pack in black  
Heads are turning

Get to shock and offend  
  
They're bad animals - bad animals

Got to push the grain or go insane

We walk the jungle line  
We stay alive

Ain't got no prescription  
They make their own styles

"So this ain't the end, I saw you again, today  
I had to turn my heart away  
Smiled like the sun, kisses for everyone  
And tales, it never fails  
  
You lying so low in the weeds  
I bet you gonna ambush me  
You'd have me down, down, down on my knees  
Now wouldn't you, Barracuda? Oh  
  
Back over time we were all trying for free  
You met the porpoise and me  
No right, no wrong you're selling a song, a name  
Whisper game  
  
If the real thing don't do the trick  
You better make up something quick  
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick  
Oooo, Barracuda, oh yeah  
  
""Sell me, sell you"" the porpoise said  
Dive down deep to save my head  
You, I think you got the blues too  
  
All that night and all the next  
Swam without looking back  
Made for the western pools, silly, silly fools  
  
If the real thing don't do the trick, no  
You better make up something quick  
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick  
Oooo, Barra-Barracuda

Mama's little pride and joy  
Both hands on her apron strings

Inspection with a clean white glove

The sacred and profane  
Ice and fire counteract like black on black  
The oldest story known to man  
The willing sacrificial lamb  
Behind the light a shadow falls  
The code of silence shakes the walls  
A whisper to a silent scream  
The power is so frightening  
They say that opposites attract

Like a loaded question the power of suggestion  
Like the face of danger the kindness of a stranger  
Like a Judas Kiss like pleasure and a little pain  
Immaculate seduction absolute corruption  
Ice and fire counteract no turning back  
like black on black  
Black on black.

"Young girl feeling pretty old  
Young girl in the band  
Rolling into another town  
Living the best they can  
Across the street, a music store  
She gotta find a brand new axe  
And there he was, that blue guitar  
He was staring her right back, staring her right back  
She held him close and he felt just fine  
He warmed her up, she know he was just right  
Together they cut right through the night  
She made herself a local scene  
And man that axe could sing and scream  
Crying for a big breakthrough  
Only small time local news  
Just about to pack it in  
Mr. Money Biz rolled in  
Paid the way and broke the band  
A living one night stand, living one night stand  
She held him close and he felt just fine  
He warmed her up, she know he was just right  
Together they cut right through the night  
Like touching fire  
Like holding desire  
Like touching fire  
Like holding desire  
Take this platinum, take this gold  
Burn too hot, it turns you cold  
Nothin' left to hold on to  
But that guitar was always true, that man was always true  
She held him close and he felt just fine  
He warmed her up, she know he was just right  
Together they cut right through the night  
Like touching fire  
Like holding desire  
Like touching fire  
Like holding desire

After a while there just ain't no more

Give me the truth who is running my show  
Tell them I'm sorry but I just had to go

Out of a habit that used to be fun

Pulling me down to what he understands  
He can't get his mind around no bigger plans  
No one is going to tie me to this machine  
Giving me formula force fed dreams  
Getting more hold on me than it seems

Watching it all go by Seems like I've always got a destination  
Running down the time Pushing to the front of the line

I want to be there where Christmas waits for me  
Christmas waits Gather round the fire let the weather rage outside  
Christmas waits I always will be welcome for the rest of my life Christmas

He had to shout, she had to cry  
He wanted to kill and she wanted to die

She look for love songs, he buys the drive  
But all they can pull is bad news in tonight

Of time you had before

Seeing you sigh and shake  
Broken down so low, so sad  
I can't let you break

You better not hide it  
Let it come, let it bleed  
I ain't laughing, reach in and get it  
And set it free

Is bitter on your tongue  
People don't seen wild and fine

You're lonesome over a stormy ocean  
Lost in the rain and wind  
We can clear these clouds away  
And feel the sun again

"Stand at the window  
Pull back the lace  
I feel the night wind on my face  
All that I long for - all that I crave  
Am I master, Am I slave?  
The night's so still  
I feel the lovers out in the hills  
The breathing of young girls lying in bed  
Visions of love in their heads  
Desire walks on  
Desire walks on  
A beautiful boy gazed in a pool  
His eyes looking back like jewels  
The call of the mirror - too strong to resist  
The call of the water - the call of a kiss  
Desire walks on  
Desire walks on  
It wants to be held - possessed  
It wants consummation  
It moves on obsessed  
Bloodstream through pipes  
Singing in the wires  
Heat - motion - control  
Desire walks on  
Stand at the window  
The world is so still  
Calling you back by force of will  
Where did you go?  
I don't know why  
Too much longing inside  
You wrapped me in nighttime sexual disguise  
I was the love in your eyes  
You took me over  
My innocence cracked  
You own my passion  
I want you back  
Desire walks on  
Desire walks on

Arrow measured to the goal, sing of  
Strong and living man

Through the forest town  
Telling of riches only given if through  
The woods the way is found  
  
Crying ah! beautiful dancers wake up  
From your sleep!  
Ah gentle romancers, drink of love  
So sweet!  
  
Treasure glowing in their eyes, forest  
Deepens dark their dream  
Keep to the pathway he advise the woods  
Are more than they might seem  
Heed you now the apparition bending never  
Ending sounds  
Call you into her mystery, are your eyes  
Not sparkling now?

Make no foolish fight  
Ahh, think not of morning, lie here  
Through the night!

They hear her say  
Silken web falls, mist illusion rips away  
Helpless! helpless! now they scream  
Helpless on the path he stands  
And awakens from his dream singing string  
Beneath his hand  
  
Gentle archer ages old, release the aim  
Free the goal  
Roll your arrow to my soul, release the aim  
Free the goal

To get back to that place  
When passion made us wild  
No more alibis  
Standing face to face

You should know it's true

"The night is falling like an angel on your memory  
And we are well acquainted  
We are sworn enemies  
And the lonely beating of my heart tonight is only one more thing  
I gotta fight  
  
Well I think about you baby, days of heaven that we had  
Then I get to thinking maybe, maybe too much thinking's bad  
Well, my mind takes no prisoners, pities no one  
Spares not even me till the harm is done  
  
Here I go again  
The night just walked in  
In walks the night  
In walks my fantasy  
Darkness all around me  
And I'm dying for the light  
  
I reach down for a little strength deep inside  
Well I know I love my freedom, but lonely feelings come and go  
And night time is a season  
Feel the cold wind blow  
  
And I toss and I turn and I walk the floor  
I don't want to cry don't want to cry no more  
Here I go again the night just walked in  
In walks the night  
  
In walks my fantasy  
Darkness all around me  
And I'm dying for the light I reach down for a little strength deep inside  
I reach down for my sanity  
If only these eyes could see through all the emptiness I found around me  
In walks the night  
  
I can almost feel you in the darkness all around  
Still I'm waiting for the break of day  
Waiting for a miracle a dream that won't wander away  
Well my mind takes no prisoners pities no one  
It spares not even me till the harm is done  
  
Here I go again  
The night just walked in  
In walks the night  
In walks my fantasy  
Darkness all around me  
And I'm dying for the light  
  
I reach down for a little strength deep inside  
I reach down for my sanity  
If only these eyes would see through all the emptiness I found around me  
  
In walks the night  
The night just walked in  
In walks the night  
The night just walked in  
Maybe I'll be all right

Christmas is the time of year When miracles are done You can give your hand to
a friend in need A smile to a sad someone Your best friend knocks upon your
door And asks if you want to play You don't feel much like sharing your toys
But you share them anyway You make the time to take some time With dear and
special ones Christmas is the time of year When miracles are done Open up your
heart it's Christmas time Illuminate the dark it's Christmas time Shine a
little light into the world It's Christmas time Christmas is the time of year
when music's in the air Timeless and familiar songs You hear them everywhere
Even Ebenezer Scrooge sang on Christmas day Something's living in those songs
That all hearts long to say Open up your heart it's Christmas time Illuminate

"Spare a little candle  
Save some light for me  
Figures up ahead  
Moving in the trees  
White skin in linen  
Perfume on my wrist  
And the full moon that hangs over  
These dreams in the mist  
  
Darkness on the edge  
Shadows where I stand  
I search for the time  
On a watch with no hands  
I want to see you clearly  
Come closer than this  
But all I remember  
Are the dreams in the mist  
  
These dreams go on when I close my eyes  
Every second of the night I live another life  
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside  
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away  
  
Is it cloak n dagger  
Could it be spring or fall  
I walk without a cut  
Through a stained glass wall  
Weaker in my eyesight  
The candle in my grip  
And words that have no form  
Are falling from my lips  
  
These dreams go on when I close my eyes  
Every second of the night I live another life  
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside  
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away  
  
There's something out there  
I can't resist  
I need to hide away from the pain  
There's something out there  
I can't resist

That I've ever heard  
Funny how your feet  
In dreams never touch the earth  
In a wood full of princes  
Freedom is a kiss  
But the prince hides his face  
From dreams in the mist  
  
These dreams go on when I close my eyes  
Every second of the night I live another life  
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside  
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

"What a day you had today  
It took your smile away  
I think we ought to get away  
Let's run away  
  
Take me out under the sky  
Counting diamonds all through the night  
And the moon in the morning light  
Out under the sky  
  
And it can happen any day  
Everything goes astray  
But the starts do us o.k.  
Let's run away  
  
Hey hey hey yeah yeah, out under the sky  
Hey hey hey yeah yeah, out under the sky  
Hey hey hey yeah yeah, out under the sky  
Out under the sky  
  
It's all right, let it go  
Shake the world off you shoulders  
You have the perfect alibi  
Just because the world is wide  
Out under the sky  
  
Hey hey hey yeah yeah, out under the sky  
Hey hey hey yeah yeah, out under the sky  
Out under the sky  
  
When all is said and done  
Darlin' we are the only ones  
There's only you and I  
Out under the sky  
Out under the sky  
Out under the sky

"Below the bridge the water rose on by  
Trouble's gone and time is on my side  
Been living in my ordinary shoes  
Walkin' off my ordinary blues  
  
Once upon a love so bright and true  
The weather changed, it went to Sunday School  
Once upon a dark and stormy day  
The promises dried up and blew away  
  
I found myself a brand new neighborhood  
Don't worry about me 'cause I'm walkin' good  
Take tomorrow, I'm giving up the past  
Nothing but a hobo walkin' good at last  
  
Anyway I'm okay  
Day into night and night into day  
Gone so far away from my home  
Take the high road and down below  
  
Anyway I'm okay  
Day into night and night into day  
Gone so far away from my home

"In troubled times  
It's hard to get straight answers  
Between the lines  
That border wrong or right  
The homeland cries  
It struggles with confusion  
But this feelin' still remains  
Like shelter from the rain  
  
We live of faith  
In the hands of those who guide us  
And tear the page  
On the fear we left behind  
We set the pace  
For every born survivor  
Don't turn the other way  
When I need to hear you say  
  
Allies with our backs against the wall  
I will answer when you call  
And take on the odds  
For what we believe is true  
Allies in a world of too much choice  
I only need your voice  
To tell me you care  
I'll be anywhere for you, allies  
  
We search our hearts  
To justify the reason  
And draw the line  
To meet somewhere halfway  
If faith is blind  
Through darkness it will guide us  
'Cause the spirit still remains  
With the keepers of the flame  
  
Allies with our backs against the wall  
I will answer when you call  
And take on the odds  
For what we believe is true  
Allies in a world of too much choice

I'd almost given up, you must have read my mind  
And all these dreams I save for a rainy day  
They're finally coming true, I'll share them all with you  
'Cause now we hold the future in our hands

Safe in the trees you had tears on your face  
Wrestling with your desires frozen strangers

Moonlight holding me light as down  
Voice of confusion inside of me  
No begging to go back where I'm free

He's good enough  
He's sweet enough  
He's man enough a little touch  
I need so much  
I want so much  
I need to feel that secret touch  
Why can't I break out  
Why won't he reach out for me  
Oh Loneliness  
It comes and it goes  
But lately loneliness loneliness  
It just grows and grows and grows  
Cause here he is living deep inside  
Nowhere nowhere nowhere to hide

"""I'm the one who can please you""  
Ain't that what you said  
You seemed so alone  
I guess I was easily led  
  
I showed you my love  
But I guess that it went to your head  
When you were hungry  
I brought you your breakfast in bed  
  
Even it up, even it up, even it up  
Even it up, even it up, even it up  
A good man pays his debt  
But you ain't paid yours yet  
Even it  
Even it up  
  
I took you down over the tracks when  
You wanted some sin  
I brought you satin and herbs from  
The places I been  
Now something tells me you're  
Going to use me again  
You think you can lay down the how and  
The where and the when  
  
Even it up, even it up, even it up  
Even it up, even it up, even it up  
I don't want to bum it all  
But this ax she got to fall  
Even it  
Even it up

Seems like he's everywhere!

Late night in the penthouse room, the fire is burning  
Shadows are warm, laying in his arms she answers his yearning  
Her eyes are filled with sand

Used but the way you do those things to me, how can I

A hard racy game of give and take  
Leaves them dazed, half crazed, in her wake

"I keep my secrets locked up tight  
I keep my emotions out of sight  
But you got me memorized  
What's in my heart, what's behind my eyes  
You hold me tight, you hold me fast  
Won't let go until the storm has passed  
When I finally break down I'm so in love  
I ain't afraid to ask, I am not afraid, no  
Baby, love me out, love me out of this world  
No alibis, no more regrets  
You're my wayward angel  
You're my saving grace  
Sanctify my crazy head  
You're there inside me, in my dreams  
Sexy poems, cinematic scenes  
Shattered lullabies unfold  
Sweet suggestions I have never known  
Pull down the shade, turn off the light  
Oh, my love were all alone tonight  
Shadow dancing in slow-mo  
For your eyes I will let it show  
You can feel me glow  
Oh, baby, love me out, love me out of this world  
No alibis, no more regrets  
You're my wayward angel  
You're my saving grace  
Sanctify my crazy head  
Maybe it's heaven or your sweet suggestion  
Holding me in your sway  
Carried away in the arms of an angel  
You are my saving grace  
Baby, love me out, love me out of this world  
No alibis, no more regrets, oh  
You're my wayward angel  
You're my saving grace  
Sanctify my crazy head  
Oh, baby, love me out now, love me out of this world  
No alibis, no more regrets, no more regrets  
You're my wayward angel  
You're my saving grace  
Sanctify my crazy head, oh, ooh

I wanna tell you, let me say  
Dreaming never looked so true  
One word ain't enough  
Heaven's finding eyes in you

Children hide with pretty words, oh  
So many times we seem to find  
Children play too rough  
Never too late for what we are made for  
How can I say love?  
All this feeling here inside  
One word ain't enough

Why do we wind up so alone?  
How many roads do we gotta travel on  
Till we find out we're already home?  
Already home

One word ain't enough  
The way to say it seems to hide  
How can I say love?

Outside my window surrounded by a glow  
You were a young man troubled hadn't found its way  
You were smiling, that's all you had to say

The streets were busy, the cafes and the bars  
People laughing, the flash of cars  
The neon tower like a fist up in the sky  
All that power like a spit in heaven's eye

Rusted angels floating everywhere  
St. Michael singing to the spirits passing by  
To blacked out windows and the silence there inside

The alley in the rain  
The hotel by a train  
The well known ghosts remain

And time is running backwards and so is the bride

Where the four winds blow  
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know  
That the rush hour is now on the wheel  
And the plow and the sun is going down  
Upon the sacred cow  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
  
Ring them bells Saint Martha for the poor man's son  
Ring them bells so the world will know that God is one  
For the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep  
And the mountains are filled with little lost sheep  
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf  
Ring them bells for all of us who are left  
Ring them bells for the chosen few  
Who would judge the many when the game is through  
Ring them bells for the time that flies,  
For the child that cries when  
Innocence dies  
Ring them bells Saint Catherine  
From the top of the room  
Ring them bells from the fortress  
From the lilies that bloom  
For the lines they are long  
And the fighting is strong  
And they're breaking down the distance  
Between right and wrong  
  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells!

No dreams  
No silence

And I don't hear a sound  
But I know someone's laughing  
I'm trying hard to keep my confidence  
You take advantage of my innocence  
Where are you, how are you  
I wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
It's been so long. I'll hold on  
And wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
No one know you  
What you go though, but I do  
The phone keeps ringing  
No one know what you're thinking  
But I do, I do, I do  
They were laughing at you  
And I held out my hand  
I was trying to get through  
Without losing again  
Where are you, how are you  
I wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
It's been so long. I'll hold on  
And wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
What's that you say I can't hear you  
Are those words meant for me,  
As they appear to be  
The tension in my voice awakes you  
You know who I am but my name escapes you  
They were looking for you  
And you started to run  
If they asked about you  
I wouldn't tell anyone  
Where are you, how are you  
I wait for an answer -  
Wait for an answer  
It's been so long. I'll hold on  
And wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
The kind of woman I am  
I do things that you can't understand  
But there are times when you should  
Check the line on my face  
Don't look at me now  
Look at me now  
Look at me now  
Where are you, how are you  
I wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
It's been so long. I'll hold on  
And wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
I'll wait, you make me wait  
Someone told me to call

"I've been lonely  
I've been waiting for you  
I'm pretending and that's all I can do  
The love I'm sending  
Ain't making it through to your heart  
  
You've been hiding - never letting it show  
Always trying to keep it under control  
You got it down and you're well  
On your way to the top  
But there's something that you forgot  
  
What about love  
Don't you want someone to care about you  
What about love  
Don't let it slip away  
What about love  
I only want to share it with you  
You might need it some day  
  
I can't tell you what you're feeling inside  
And I can't sell you what you don't want to buy  
Something's missing and you got to  
Look back on your life  
You know something here just ain't right  
  
What about love  
Don't you want someone to care about you  
What about love  
Don't let it slip away  
What about love  
I only want to share it with you  
  
What about love  
Don't you want someone to care about you  
What about love  
Don't let it slip away  
What about love  
I only want to share it with you

"Night inside the city  
Empty sidewalks  
Stretching under dizzy lights  
Rain is hummin'  
The streets are runnin'  
Underneath the neon lights  
We run together  
We'll run forever  
Outta here ridin' the wheels  
  
Look at pretty windows  
At shiny people  
Statues under sparkling lights  
Just take a picture  
And a melted moment  
Flashin' on the crazy ride  
Just close your eyes now  
And breathe a sigh now  
We're gettin' outta here  
Outta here  
Ridin' the wheels  
(Ridin' the wheels)  
Ooh  
Ridin' the wheels  
(Ridin' the wheels)  
Ridin' the wheels  
  
(Wheels)  
  
Outta here, ridin' the wheels  
(Ridin' the wheels)  
Ridin' the wheels  
Ridin' the wheels  
(Ridin' the wheels)  
Ridin', ridin' the wheels  
(Ridin' the wheels)  
Ridin', ridin', ridin' the wheels  
Ridin' the wheels  
Ooh  
Oh  
Aye

"This night's gone, we're moving on  
Highway's calling aloud  
I bring them in with eyes of sin  
It's a down drinkin' freaky crowd  
Chew you up and spit you out  
Never want to know your name  
Don't want to know you but I sure want to show you  
Never will forget I came  
On the world's all mine  
White lightning and wine came on so fast  
When did I last feel this fine?  
White lightning and wine  
Sweet little one let me love you some  
Take me or leave me alone  
The gooder they come, the harder they fall  
Turn around you are a nasty joke  
Yeah, we all laugh oh, hah, what a gas!  
Watching you chew on the bones  
In the morning light you didn't look so nice  
Guess you'd better hitch hike home

"It's too late to turn back  
When the green lights flash  
Too late to turn around  
When the love goes down  
  
Your fire my fate  
This woman won't wait  
So love beam your laser light  
Get ready gonna take this flight  
  
You're so wild  
(you're wild and willing)  
So wild (your spirit's free)  
You're such a wild wild child  
Oh baby go wild with me  
  
Two hearts one mind  
Baby you're my kind  
You're too hot you're too much  
You've got that personal touch  
  
Push button play thing  
Make my back door ring  
Fight fire with a little fire baby  
You oughta know you make this  
Little girl sing  
  
You're so wild  
(you're wild and willing)  
So wild (your spirit's free)  
You're such a wild wild child  
Oh baby go wild with me  
  
Do your little shake baby  
Rattle and roll  
Ring my bell baby do my soul  
Don't let the grass grow under my feet  
Bang my drum baby feel my beat  
You're so wild  
  
You're so wild  
(you're wild and willing)  
So wild (your spirit's free)  
You're such a wild wild child  
Oh baby go wild with me  
  
You're so wild

So wild (your spirit's free)  
You're such a wild wild child  
Oh baby go wild with me

"I'm lying beside you just thinking about us  
Too tired to go to sleep and too much in love  
I know I'm crazy but I can't close my eyes  
I'm scared you won't be there in the morning when I rise  
Will you be there?  
Who do you dream about are you alone in your sleep?  
To who will you reach out?  
Oh, let it be me  
Oh baby, you're my obsession, my addiction, my drug  
Don't want to be without you when I wake up  
Will you be there in the morning, will you be there when I want you?  
Will you be there when I wake up, oh I need you to be there in the morning  
Will you be there?  
  
Well, you're so close to me but I feel so alone  
The more I touch you the more I want  
Don't know what to do about me loving you but I pray to god that you feel it
too  
You're my obsession, my addiction, my drug, so let the candle grow into a
great fire of love  
Will you be there in the morning, will you be there when I want you?  
Will you be there when I wake up?  
I need you to be there in the morning!  
I wanna love you forever,  
Don't want a love that's now or never  
Can't you see you got me down on the floor.  
I want more more!  
  
Will you be there in the morning, will you be there when I want you?  
Will you be there when I wake up?  
Will you be there in the morning?  
Will you be there?

"Well I can't forget this evening  
Though your face as you were leaving  
But I guess that's just the way the story goes  
You always smile but in your eyes the sorrow show  
Yes it shows  
And I can't forget tomorrow  
When I think of all your sorrow  
When I had you there  
and then let you go  
And now it's only fair that I should let you know  
Yeah -- gotta know  
I can't live if living is without you  
I can't give I can't give anymore  
I can't live if living is without you  
I can't give I can't give anymore  
Well I can't forget this evening  
though your face as you were leaving  
But I guess that's just the way the story goes  
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows  
yes it shows  
I can't live if living is without you  
I can't give I can't give anymore no no more

"What in the world did I do to deserve you  
I don't understand why you treat me that way  
You knew you were everything that I ever wanted  
You had your own ways of makin' me pay  
  
Then you took it just a little to far  
Now I see you for what you are  
I don't need the heartache anymore  
  
Lovin' you was an endless fight  
I was wrong and you were always right  
But look what happened when I called your bluff  
When the truth comes out  
You aint' so tough - no  
  
You turned me into an emotional prisoner  
You hit me with words that cut to the bone - oh  
Then you kissed me and made me believe that I needed you  
And think I could never survive on my own - oh no  
  
Never thought that I would break away  
Now I see right through your power play  
And I don't feel so helpless after all  
  
Lovin' you was an endless fight  
I was wrong and you were always right  
But look what happened when I called your bluff  
When the truth comes out  
Hey, you aint' so tough  
  
You took me too far to forgive it  
That was your last mistake  
That was your last mistake  
  
Lovin' you was an endless fight  
I was wrong and you were always right  
But look what happened when I called your bluff  
When the truth comes out  
You aint' so tough  
You take it all but you don't give back  
You feel strong when the odds are stacked  
There comes a time when enough's enough  
When the truth comes out  
You aint' so tough  
You aint' so tough

"We have the chance to turn the pages over  
We can write what we want to write  
We gotta make ends meet, before we get much older  
We're all someone's daughter We're all someone's son  
How long can we look at each other Down the barrel of a gun?  
You're the voice, try and understand it  
Make a noise and make it clear  
Oh-wo-wo-wo, oh-wo-wo-wo  
We're not gonna sit in silence  
We're not gonna live with fear  
Oh-wo-wo-wo, oh-wo-wo-wo  
This time, we know we all can stand together  
With the power to be powerful  
Believing we can make it better  
We're all someone's daughter  
We're all someone's son  
How long can we look at each other  
Down the barrel of a gun?
