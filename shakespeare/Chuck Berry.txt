Aimlessly drifting to no end

Is just to have a happy home  
All that I ask of one little girl

"So long, Jean, got a little show, thanks for the Bordeaux  
I got to go, push my pirough way down the bayou  
They got a band up on the stand and a beautiful light show  
Au revoir, Jean, dig the show from up on the plateau  
In my pirough, with my Bordeaux, out on the bayou  
Creeping along, singing a song, see'est, see'est bon, bon  
Playing the music on my acoustic Spanish guitaro  
Having a duet with my coquette out on the bayou  
It's growing night, we've got no lights out on the bayou  
Beautiful trip, think we'll sip some of my Bordeaux  
Two more miles going wild to play my acoustic  
See them stand to clap their hands to hear my music  
One more mile, we rested awhile and sipped on some Bordeaux  
While we's grooving, a fog was moving in on the bayou  
On my knee, just couldn't see the front of my pirough  
We didn't mind, we just reclined and sipped some more Bordeaux  
Ay-ay, Jean, I missed the show up on the plateau  
Si vous plait, push my pirough back up the bayou  
No see the band, no see the stand, no see the light show  
Ahh, Jean, we had a show out on the bayou

"When he was a child, just a baby boy  
He wanted to play rock music and sing some songs of joy  
When he started school, he just could pat his feet  
The first song he ever learned had a strong boogie beat  
Come on now  
Rock it, rock it, rock it along  
Roll it, roll it, roll it on  
Git it, git it, git it on  
Got it, got it, got it and gone  
Then one day it happened, they hauled him off to war  
Way over there in no man's land, just him and his guitar  
Nobody near to love him, nobody ever sent him news  
What could a poor boy do at night, but to sit down and sing them blues  
Early one morning they called him, oh, what a beautiful day  
They packed him in an old army plane and flew him back home to stay  
He landed in Clark Air base, but didn't have no place to go  
So he sit down with his guitar in the middle of the street and gave everybody
a free show.

Maarching on his arm she whispered, ""Pa, I still love you""

"If I were a pendulum swing and you were the bird in the cuckoo clock  
Ev'ry time you cucko-cooed I would double tick another tick tock  
I'd double my swing ev'ry time you'd sing we'd make good time with each other  
Oh, but that would be just so much fun cooin' and swingin' together  
If I were a little bitty boy and I had just a little bit o' credit  
I would make a loan for an ice cream cone and I'd go right away and get it  
You would lick a little and I would lick a little, we surely could lick with
each other  
Oh, but that would be just so much fun, eating it all together  
And if I were a little honey bee and you were a little butterfly  
I would be waiting at the garden gate until you came fluttering by  
Maybe you'd stop on a red rose top and then we could talk to each other  
Oh, but we cou'd flutter up so much fun being in the garden together  
But I'm just an ordinary guy and I love all the things you do  
You seem such a talented, beautiful girl and I'm afraid to even talk to you  
If I were as bold like some guys, hearin' them talk to each other  
I'd come over and ask you if we could go out together  
But if you were a Mercedes-Benz, I'd have to be a Fleetwood Brougham  
And ev'ry time I saw you rollin' on the freeway I think I'd have to follow you
home  
You could let me lodge in your double garage, bumper to bumper out of the
weather  
Nobody home but the Benz and the Brougham, really rarin' to roll off together

Seems everyone I meet  
Gives me a friendly Hello!  
Guess I'm just a lucky so and so  
  
Birds in every tree  
Seem all so near to me  
They sing wherever I go  
Guess I'm just a lucky so and so

If you should ask me the amount  
In my bank account  
I would have to confess  
That I'm slipping

Confidentially, I got a dream that I'm tip in

Each night, I hurry to  
Home where love ways I know

"Hello, I'm just a fan who had to call you on the phone  
Someone you won't remember of the many that you own  
I'm just a name within your past you met while all alone  
Someone who shared a love with you and stayed behind unknown  
I know I'm only someone else in love with you in vain  
I wish I could have helped myself, but love is so much pain  
It makes me feel that there is still a chance that may remain  
That you will someday surely come and give me love again  
I knew your love would never be as deep as mine for you  
And I knew that these many nights I'd be alone and blue  
And lie awake while you forsake the only love I knew  
And never learn that you'll return and we would live it through  
Each time I dream a dream, I dream we're cuddled arm in arm  
It seems you're looking straight at me, when I see you perform  
Sometimes I think you see my face become so shy and warm  
I often wonder if you know the power in your charms  
Please, let me say I still love you before you hang the phone  
And I am proud to once have shared the beauty that you own  
I'm just a name within your past you met while all alone  
Someone who shared a love with you and stayed behind unknown

""Ain't it dark in there, ooh, it's too dark in there  
Will you take me somewhere else, darlin', 'cause it's too dark in there""

It's too dark out there, so dark out there  
Let's go back into town and do something 'cause it's too dark out there""

She said, ""Maybe to a scary movie picture show""  
I said, ""It's too dark in there""  
I said, ""It's too dark in there

"Chorus: Slow down, little Jaguar  
Keep cool, little Thunderbird Ford  
Ten miles stretch on an Indiana road  
T'was a sky blue Jaguar and a Thunderbird Ford  
Jaguar setting on ninety nine  
Tryin' to beat the Bird to the county line  
Just a half-a-mile from Newtonville  
There had a speed sign sitting at the top of the hill  
It said : ""35 miles, and stay in line""  
But the Jaguar and Thunderbird never read the sign  
Chorus  
Ludenville was a real small town  
Had a hundred and two  
And nine acres of ground  
Some stool pigeon put the sheriff wise  
Told him ""Park down in Newtonville  
And catch 'em guys""  
Sheriff laid down, half hid in the weeds  
Parked for eight days, didn't nobody speed  
All of a sudden, dust rose on the road  
Said ""Here come the Jaguar and Thunderbird Ford""  
Chorus  
Sheriff doubled clutched second, put it in third  
Took right after the Jaguar and Thunderbird  
He knew he'd get a bonus and a big fat fine  
If he caught 'em 'fore they crossed that county line  
Sheriff never drove his car a hundred and flat  
But if he aimed to get 'em  
He'd have to do more than that  
Crest of the hill, he's about a mile behind  
There wasn't but two mor miles to the county line  
Chorus  
Old Sheiff was countin' on the downward grade  
With the tall wind pushin', he had it made  
Thunderbird saw the Jaguar gainin' speed  
And waved ""Goodbye, Jaguar"" and pulled in the lead  
Jaguar said ""You ain't won the race yet""  
And pulled back around the Bird like a sabre jet  
Sheriff's front bumper was a yard behind  
When the T-Bird, Jaguar crossed the line  
Slow down little Jaguar,  
Keep cool little Thunderbird Ford

And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop.

Akie rice, salt fish are nice,

"It was in ancient history, four thousand B.C.  
Back up in the jungle in a coconut tree  
Hanging on a branch up under the sun  
Was a meddlesome monkey named Jo Jo Gunne  
Old Leo the lion came down from the mountain  
To get a drink of water from the jungle fountain  
Jo Jo the monkey started tellin' him jive  
About the elephant who was gonna skin him alive  
Leo tried to reach and grab Jo Jo's tail  
Got mad and went roarin' through the jungle trail  
He ran upon an elephant beneath a tree  
And said, put up your dukes you gotta tussle with me  
An ol' eagle from Asia made a non stop flight  
Tryin' to make it in time, just to see them fight  
A crocodile phoned and reversed the charge  
Coming all the way from India on a local barge  
Ol' gorilla heard 'em talking in the lion's den  
But Jo Jo bet him three bucks the elephant wins  
Jo Jo yelled at Leo, Go on, knock him down  
He don't outweigh you but a thousand pounds  
Leo left wailin' with a left upper cut  
The elephant took his snoot and grabbed a coconut  
Leo fired a beautiful short back cross  
That's when the coconut landed up against his jaw  
Leo grew tired, but he wouldn't give in  
The elephant all loose, beat his jawbone in  
The buzzard said, they fought furious all day  
He couldn't understand how Leo got away  
Jo Jo runnin' everywhere, spreadin' the news  
To the zebras and the leopards and the kangaroos  
A hoot owl reported everything he saw  
Had his eyes wide open, they called it a draw  
Leo limping back with his jawbone bruised  
Jo Jo in the trees started singin' the blues  
Laughin', meddling, jumpin' up and down  
Till his foot missed a limb and he fell to the ground  
Just like a bolt of thunder and a streak of heat  
Leo covered Jo Jo with all four feet  
Jo Jo was screamin' with tears in his eyes  
Said, please mister Leo, I apologize  
Said, if you let my feet upon solid ground  
I'll fight you close range, fifteen rounds  
Leo got back to the square of the fight  
Jo Jo took a leap and jumped... out of sight

Try to put me through to her in Memphis Tennessee

Drove for the curb, raised up the hood  
Couldn't see nothing wrong, line o' cars long  
Traffic bogged down, tryin' to drive around  
Officer Lamar, walkin' toward the car:

""You cannot stop it here, now move it"", ""Move it""  
""Get out of there, move it""  
Three and two the count, bases loaded down  
Slugger at the plate, known to hit 'em straight  
Tension from the fans, shoutin' in the stands  
Signal from the catch, pitcher's in the stretch  
Bat 'n' ball crack, pitcher's backin' back:

""The ball is droppin' past, now"" ""Move it!""  
""Let the ball, now, let's go home, now, move it!""

She dresses like a fish, makes you look and wish  
Puts you in a trance, body built to dance  
Disco queen, twistin' in between

Pretty, wow!

We could sit and rap together, spinning records old and new

Children strolling, singing carols, makin' tracks out in the snow

My grandma bought me a cute little toy  
Two silver bells on a string  
She told me it was my ding-a-ling-a-ling

Always went by the very best rule  
But every time the bell would ring  
You'd catch me playing with my ding-a-ling  
  
Once while climbing the garden wall,  
Slipped and fell had a very bad fall  
I fell so hard I heard birds sing,  
But I held on to my ding-a-ling  
  
Once while swimming cross turtle creek  
Man them snappers right at my feet  
Sure was hard swimming cross that thing  
With both hands holding my ding-a-ling  
  
Now this here song it ain't so bad  
Prettiest little song that you ever had  
And those of you who will not sing  
Must be playing with your on ding-a-ling

Yesterday, she came to me and held my hand  
Said she was blue and oh so lonesome  
And would I try to understand  
I didn't know till this morning  
How much my woman means to me  
This morning when I got home, she was not there  
I noticed her clothes were gone  
And a little note lay on my shelf

But I'll be gone, I don't know where  
Today I got the blues and I got 'em bad  
Last night as I lay sleeping  
My conscious will not go to rest  
Yesterday I lost the best woman I ever had  
One of these days, can't say where and I don't know when  
It may be in time, it may be soon  
It may be in a place I've never been

Downtown searching for her, looking all around.  
Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading up town.  
I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab.  
With a twenty dollar bill, told him 'catch that yellow cab.'  
  
She move around like a wave of summer breeze,  
Go, driver, go, go, catch her balmy breeze.  
Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier.  
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear.

Since you've been gone her eyes have clouded  
And darkness reigns her weary view

Tell him we need him quick, 'cuz he may have to testify  
That you been sick all day and that's a perfect alibi

"A stranger lying on a bar room floor  
Had drank so much he could drink no more,  
And so he fell asleep with a troubled brain  
To dream that he rode on that down bound train.  
  
The engine with blood was sweaty and damp  
And brilliantly lit with a brimstone lamp,  
And imps for fuel was shovelling bones  
While the furnace rang with a thousand groans.  
  
The boiler was filled with lots of beer  
The devil himself was the engineer,  
The passengers were most a motley crew,  
Some were foreigners and others he knew.  
  
Rich men and lost beggars in rags  
Handsome young ladies and wicked old hags.  
As the train rushed on at a terrible pace  
Sulphuric fumes scorched their hands and face,  
  
Wider and wider the country grew  
Faster and faster the engine flew,  
Louder and louder the thunder crashed  
Brighter and brighter the lighting flashed,  
  
Hotter and hotter the air became  
Til their clothes were burned with each quivering refrain.  
Then out of the din there came a yell  
Ha ha said the devil we're nearing home,  
  
Oh how the passengers shrieked with pain  
They go to Satan with this down bound train.  
The stranger awoke with an anguished cry  
His clothes wet with sweat and his hair standing high,  
  
He fell on his knees on the bar room floor  
And prayed a prayer like never before.  
And the prayers and vows were not in vain  
For he never rode that down bound train.

Despite the joy around me  
I can't free myself from sorrow  
All through the day it's a wonder  
Fall will the night, still I wonder  
If I'm the only  
Or are you as lonely  
Come home to me tomorrow  
Why should the past so change  
How you feel!  
Oh but I ask you  
""Forgive, if you will""  
These lonely hours are  
So hard to bear  
I don't deny that I was unfair  
You paid enough to be gay  
Who made me love you this way?  
So give me the chance  
To renew our romance  
For this time I know it will stay  
Oh yes, this time I know it will stay

Catch me playing with my ding-a-ling  
  
Once I was climbing the garden wall,  
I slipped and had a terrible fall  
I fell so hard I heard bells ring,  
But held on to My ding-a-ling  
  
Once I was swimming cross turtle creek  
Man them snappers all around my feet  
Sure was hard swimming cross that thing  
With both hands holding my ding-a-ling

You must be playing with your own Ding-a-ling

All the way home I held a grudge

Half way 'cross Alabam,

Ridin' cross Mississippi clean

Smoking into New Orleans.

Just help me get to Houston town.  
There's people there who care a little 'bout me  
And they won't let the poor boy down.

Put luggage in my hands,

"My friend finally made a record and took to the road and played guitar  
He met this girl from Pennsylvania stuck by his side in love and war  
Fearful and fussy, but so faithful, poor and devoted, real and true  
She's not the type to be forsaken and I see much of her in you  
  
While on a gig up in Toronto during a pause between his show  
He met this foxy German stallion who understood him head to toe  
She played it smart and learned his weakness and made him confess and yield
into  
Her lustful whims became his fancy and I would fear the same from you  
  
Then in the swank suburbs of Houston off in a mansion built of stone  
Escorted by this wealthy widow into her lounge and left alone  
Her maid announced that she was waiting for him to come and rendezvous  
Where he bestowed a long relation one like I hope to have with you  
  
Then on the sands right off the ocean just as the sun sank in the sea  
So did my buddy slow and easy into a freak of fancy-free  
It was a group in automation getting together two by two  
Where people live and love one another, people who live like me and you  
  
Then on the beach in warm Miami there was a teacher far from school  
Taught him the way to please a woman, made him concede the Golden Rule  
He learned to do it unto others as he used to just have them do  
So they began to come together as I will try to do with you  
  
And there was one who was a virgin, never been touched by anyone  
She was as pure as any angel, in fact she's called to be a nun  
But it was all because my buddy just couldn't spoil a girl so true  
And so he left her as he found her, like I may have to do with you  
  
The girl he's got now, he's never left her, she was the first I thought he'd
shun  
Until I saw my buddy's eyes, when she came forth and bore his son  
Since then he's known no other woman, I think his ramblin' days are through  
They built a home up in the country, a life I'd love to build with you  
  
Although you've never known my buddy and I am sure he don't know you  
But you know the life he's living and all of the changes he's been through

I could be happy with you only 'cause I see all of them in you

Many times we kissed goodbye  
Sometimes I dream we are together  
Wake up moanin' your name thru sleepy eyes  
And I wanna scream that I still love you  
But you're not there, I got to realize

But he sing such a sad song, and the guitar he broke.  
The donkey stop, the man he reach to get a big jug,  
Him and the donkey take a sip o' the drink.  
  
Down the road, oh the dancing donkey,  
Head swingin' so high, all the pain now gone.  
The man he sing, some song was a gay song,  
And the little donkey kept a-dancin' on.  
  
Down the road was the man and the donkey,  
So good feel the donkey, so gay was the man.  
How plain when the wind blow was the sound of the gay song,  
When the man and the donkey kept a-movin' on down the road.

"Things that I used to do  
Some I won't do no more  
Things that I used to do  
Some I won't do no more  
  
Used to sit and hold your hand, baby  
Begging you, not today  
  
Used to search all night for you baby  
And I search always anything  
Used to search all night for you baby  
And I search always anything  
Yeah, and I'm new alone again, darlin'  
You was out somewhere with your other man  
  
I'm gonna send you back to your mother, baby  
Or I'm gonna back to my family too  
I'm gonna send you back to your mother, baby  
Or I'm gonna back to my family too  
  
Nothing I ever do pleases you, darlin'  
Or I just can't get along with you

"I saw you over there  
But what could I do?  
I couldn't stand and stare  
Or come and talk to you  
And it is always fair  
To formally be introduced?  
To you especially  
  
I took it on my own  
To come an talk to you  
Because you were alone  
I hope I didn't intrude  
Observing you had shown  
That you were so lonely and blue  
  
Nothing beats a failure like a try  
There's a great reward  
Someone will surely hail you  
  
If you try  
But you must try hard  
And if I hadn't tried  
I wonder where I'd be  
If I upon relied  
On fate you meeting me  
But because I tried  
Together we'll always be  
  
Nothing beats a failure like a try  
There's a great reward  
Someone will surely hail you  
  
Oh darling  
Together we'll always be

"In the wee hours of the morning  
After all have gone to bed  
Yes, I go all to myself  
Think of things that you have said  
Yeah, but I fall asleep, do you wonder  
If there is anything for me ahead  
  
I fell in love with you, baby  
Before I even held your hand  
And you were still in your teens  
Too young to understand  
But when you looked at me and smiled, darling  
That's when it all began  
  
You know I was just sitting here thinking  
About the things we used to do  
Ah, but you now belong to someone else  
And I'm still in love with you  
You know I wonder, I wonder  
Will I ever be back with you

"In the wee, wee hours  
That's when I think of you  
In the wee, wee hours  
That's when I think of you  
You say, but yet I wonder  
If your love was ever true  
In a wee little room  
I sit alone and think of you  
In a wee little room  
I sit alone and think of you  
I wonder if you still remember  
All the things we used to do  
One little song  
For a fading memory  
One little song  
For a fading memory  
Of the one I really love  
The only one for me

"I bought a brand-new air-mobile  
It custom-made, 'twas a Flight De Ville  
With a pow'ful motor and some hideaway wings  
Push in on the button and you can hear her sing  
CHORUS:  
Now you can't catch me, baby you can't catch me  
'Cause if you get too close, you know I'm gone like a cool breeze  
New Jersey Turnpike in the wee wee hours  
I was rollin' slowly 'cause of drizzlin' showers  
Here come a flat-top, he was movin' up with me  
Then come wavin' by me in a little' old souped-up jitney  
I put my foot on my tank and I began to roll  
Moanin' siren, 'twas the state patrol  
So I let out my wings and then I blew my horn  
Bye bye New Jersey, I've become airborne  
(chorus)  
Flyin' with my baby last Saturday night  
Not a gray cloud floatin' in sight  
Big full moon shinin' up above  
Cuddle up honey, be my love  
Sweetest little thing I've ever seen  
I'm gonna name you Maybellene  
Flyin' on the beam, set on flight control  
Radio tuned to rock 'n' roll  
Two, three hours passed us by  
Five to two dropped to 5:05  
Fuel consumption way too fast  
Let's get on home before we run out of gas  
(chorus)

"Let's throw a twilight cookout  
We two, you two, no more  
Way out somewhere in the country  
Where we've never been before  
  
Let's throw it on a weekend  
We two, you two, no more  
And lounge away a holiday  
Like we've never done before  
  
We'll bring the rounds and some jazzy sound  
To play by a cozy fire  
You two roast wieners and we'll toast the buns  
And we'll chow till the night grows nighter  
  
We'll call for you on the weekend  
We two, you two, no more  
And ride out somewhere in the country air  
Just a cozy clan of four
