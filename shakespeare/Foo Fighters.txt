Another one to deceive

Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion  
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high

Though my mind could think I still was a mad man  
I hear the voices when I'm dreamin',  
I can hear them say  
  
Carry on wayward son,  
For there'll be peace when you are done  
Lay your weary head to rest  
Now don't you cry no more  
  
Masquerading as a man with a reason  
My charade is the event of the season  
And if I claim to be a wise man, it surely  
Means that I don't know  
On a stormy sea of moving emotion  
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean  
I set a course for winds of fortune, but  
I hear the voices say  
  
Carry on, you will always remember  
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor  
Now your life's no longer empty  
Surely heaven waits for you

Hard enough for you

All your mysteries  
Settle down and in good time  
We can solve all mine  
Tell me lies or tell me when  
Tear me up again  
And I will let you know  
When I've had enough  
Had enough of you

I know you've got your reasons  
Hey let's call it even  
Turn out all the lights and go to bed  
Still I get this feeling  
No one will believe me  
When I let these ghosts outside my head

Don't you deny me  
  
There's a world out there  
Don't you deny me

Masturbating with a magazine  
  
She said how'd you like to waste some time

She took me to her castle  
And I just couldn't believe my eyes  
She had so many devices  
Everything that money could buy  
She said sign your name on the dotted line

And Nikki started to grind  
  
Ahh!

Oh

Or maybe it was my brain

Oh, she'll show you no mercy  
But she'll sho' 'nough sho' 'nough show you how to grind  
  
Woke up the next morning  
Nikki wasn't there  
I looked all over and all I found  
Was a phone number on the stairs  
It said thank you for a funky time  
Call me up whenever you want to grind

Ah!

In the bowels of the cathedral  
Will you render her asunder with what she really needs  
Or will you crash that beautiful silence with some talk about  
Finding yourself in you mother's arms  
  
Will you call her a freak  
Will you call them freaks  
Or will you call them gods  
Will you call them freaks  
  
You know you sperm is weak  
You never looked, so high  
To ever find her so low  
You did not have to go, that far  
To show her you were holy  
  
Now you know they're gonna come for you  
And drag your silly name into the mud  
If the mother bears your children without tears  
And without the usual costs of labor  
  
Will you call her a freak  
Will you call them freaks  
Or will you call them gods  
Will you call them freaks

Down below the cars in the city go rushing by  
I sit here alone and I wonder why  
  
Friday night and everyone's moving  
I can feel the heat but it's soothing, heading down  
I search for the beat in this dirty town  
  
Downtown the young ones are going  
Downtown the young ones are growing  
We're the kids in America (Whoa)  
We're the kids in America (Whoa)  
Everybody live for the music-go-round  
  
Bright lights, the music gets faster  
Look, boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance  
I'm not leaving now, honey, not a chance  
Hot-shot, give me no problems  
Much later, baby, you'll be saying nevermind  
You know life is cruel, life is never kind  
  
Downtown the young ones are going  
Downtown the young ones are growing  
We're the kids in America (Whoa)

La la la la-la la-a  
La la la la-la la  
La la la la-la la-a  
La la la la-la la  
  
Come closer, honey, that's better  
Got to get a brand new experience, feeling right  
Oh, don't try to stop, baby, hold me tight  
  
Outside a new day is dawning  
Outside suburbia's sprawling everywhere  
I don't want to go, baby  
  
New York to east California  
There's a new wave coming, I warn ya  
We're the kids in America (Whoa)  
We're the kids in America (Whoa)

"It gets loneliest at night.  
Down at the liquor store.  
Beneath the neon sky.  
Our moonlight.  
Six A.M., the floor comes alive with lice.  
The pan's dried up so tight.  
With hardened beans.  
We're hungry.  
So I lean on you sometimes.  
Just to see you're still there.  
Your feet can't take the weight of one.  
Much less two.  
We hit concrete.  
How were we born into this mess?  
I know I painted you a prettier picture, baby.  
But we were run out on a rail.  
Fell from the wagon to the night train.  
I kissed the bottle.  
I should've been kissing you.  
You wake up to an empty night.  
With tears for two.  
Cigarettes they fill the gaps.  
In our empty days.  
In our broken teeth.  
We're jonesing.  
Say mister, can you spare a dime?  
Some change could make a change.  
Could buy some time.  
Some freedom.  
Or an ear to hear my story.  
It's all I've got. My fiction  
Beats the hell out of my truth.  
A palm upturned burnt blue.  
Don't call it sunburn.  
You've been shaking on the job.  
Just one drink ahead of your past.  
There's a white light coming up.  
You draw the blinds hoping it'll pass.  
I kissed the bottle.  
I should've been kissing you.  
You wake up to an empty night.  
With tears for two.  
I kissed the bottle.  
I should've been kissing you.  
You wake up to an empty night.  
With tears for two.  
I kissed the bottle.  
I should've been kissing you.

Shouldn't have a hard time getting out,  
If I had the time I could make it,  
Seems to be the chances are chasing,  
  
All the substance I've done without,  
And all the luck that I've hated,  
Aside from all of the petty doubt,  
Can't believe I have made it.  
  
I'm afraid of the dark now,  
It's the sign of a patsy,  
Round the time of the door brow,

Never put your face in the water,  
It hurts your eyes when they open up,  
Not that any different could matter,  
It's just a different conspirit.

I'm the same I'm the same I'm the same

Without a simple reason why  
Feel another afternoon  
Split my poor broken heart in two

Throwing needles at the sky  
March with friends that's you today  
Put them on and walked away

Talk about the time we spent  
Picking arms up from the sand  
Sure to never never land  
In the middle of my story  
Fuel the bed to keep you warm  
Lie around and beat my head  
Feed the cactus, i'm instead

When you thought it had everything  
  
You used to think that it was so easy  
You used to say that it was so easy  
But you're trying, you're trying now  
  
Another year and then you'll be happy  
Just one more year and then you'll be happy  
But you're crying you're crying now  
  
Way down the street there's a light in his place  
Opens the door  
He's got that look on his face  
And he asks you were you've been  
You tell him who you've seen  
And you talk about everything  
  
He's got this dream about buying some land  
He's gonna give up the crack and the one night stands  
And then he'll settle down  
In some quiet little town  
And forget about everything  
  
But you know he'll always keep moving  
You know he's never gonna stop moving  
'Cause he's rolling, he's the rolling stone  
  
When you wake up its a new morning  
The sun is shining its a new morning  
You're going, your going' home

If we can get around it

"Seems like only yesterday  
Life belonged to runaways  
Nothing here to see  
No looking back  
Every sound monotone  
Every color monochrome  
Light began to fade  
Into the black  
  
Such a simple animal  
Sterilized with alcohol  
I could hardly  
Feel me anymore  
  
Desperate and meaningless  
All filled up with emptiness  
Felt like everything  
Was said and done  
  
I lay there in the dark  
And I close my eyes  
You saved me the day  
You came alive  
  
Still I tried to find my way  
Spinning now was end of days  
Burning like a flame  
Behind my eyes  
  
Drown it out  
Drink it in  
Crown the king of suffering  
Prisoner, slave to the disguise  
  
Disappear the only thing  
Bittersweet surrendering  
Knew that it was time  
To say goodbye  
  
I lay there in the dark  
And I close my eyes  
You saved me the day  
You came alive  
No reason left  
Me to survive  
You saved me  
The day you came alive

Come now, I'm leaving here tonight  
Come now, let's leave it all behind  
Is that the price you pay  
Running through hell  
Heaven can wait  
  
Long road to ruin  
There in your eyes  
Under the cold streetlights  
No tomorrow  
No dead ends  
  
Long road to ruin  
There in your eyes  
Under the cold streetlights  
No tomorrow  
No dead ends

Promise not to say another word  
Never mind what's done is done  
Always was a lucky one  
  
Watch the sunrise all alone  
Sitting on the tracks  
Hear the train come roaring in  
Never coming back  
  
Laying quiet in the grass  
Everything is still  
River stones and broken bones  
Scattered on the hill  
  
Promise I will be forever yours  
Promise not to say another word  
Never mind what's done is done  
Always was a lucky one  
  
Promise I will be forever yours  
Promise not to say another word  
Here forever deep beneath the dirt  
Never mind what's done is done  
Always was a lucky one

"Early morning without warning  
Woke me with a scare  
I had that dream again  
That the sun was dead  
Make me warm or take me home  
It's so cold in here  
Can't we meet somewhere  
Is it winter there?  
Is it winter there?  
This winter  
  
[Chorus]  
Meet me in the summer time  
We can move the air  
Sweet Virginia countryside  
I will meet you there  
Bloody lips and cherry wine  
Moonshine in your hair  
Just keep staring at the sun  
Pray for summer's end  
  
Come on over brave my storm  
Ocean's overhead  
Come inside my friend  
Getting bad out there  
Every moment we have stolen  
All we had to share  
No one wanted this  
But you know I did  
You know I did  
This moment

Sit and bleach one anyway, that's why

No sweat yeah, wow right  
You're a retard anyway, that's right  
Stand to beat your ass away, wow right

"Shame on you  
Seducing everyone  
Faded you  
Your diamond in the rough  
  
You don't have to tell me  
I know where you've been  
Shinning once again  
  
Will you do  
The thing you've always done  
Tell me true  
I think you know the one  
  
One that makes me blurry  
Colors start to run  
  
Every time I wonder  
I go under  
  
The deeper the blues  
The more I see black  
Sweeter the brew the feeling starts coming back  
All the deepest blues are black

"That night they were burning for truth  
Down on the corner of 14th and u  
They took your soul and they took you for fools  
Took all the windows from prisons and schools  
Now what's a poor man left to do?

You start untying the answer of the youth  
New kids hear the sound of the drumming  
Mother nature your summer is coming  
Yesterday and today revolution on it's way

Out of the basement and into the news  
Come change now shit getting heavy  
Salvation at the ready  
You look when I walk by  
Still screaming till I die  
  
Can't find peace if you can't find a home  
You can't survive as an island alone  
Black heart with a gaping wound  
Put back together by a troubled groove  
Check yourself wreck your brains  
Where is that BMA

It was the feast and the famine

To the dreams we forget?  
We need a monument  
And a change will come  
Yeah change will come

In another life  
Until the day I die

Save it for the last goodbye

The sacrifice, the knowing to survive  
The first decline, another state of mind

Anything but play to me  
In order

Fallen into something deep

Anointed

Now that all of that is done  
Wish I would've felt I've won
