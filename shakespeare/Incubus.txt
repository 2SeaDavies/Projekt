"7 am  
The garbage truck  
Beeps as it backs up  
And I start my day thinking about  
What I've thrown away  
Could I push rewind?  
All the credits strewn  
In signifying the end  
But I missed the best part  
Could we please go back  
To the start?  
Forgive my indecision  
  
Then again, then again, then again  
You're always first when  
No one's on your side  
Then again, then again, then again  
The day will come when  
I want off that ride  
  
11 am  
By now you would think  
That I would be up  
But my bedsheets shade  
The heated choices I made  
What did I find?  
I never thought I could want  
Someone so much  
'Cause now you're not here  
And I'm knee deep  
In my own fear  
Forgive my indecision  
I am only a man  
  
Then again, then again, then again  
You're always first when  
No one's on your side  
Then again, then again, then again  
The day will come when  
I want off that ride  
  
12 pm and my dusty telephone rings  
I get up from my pillow  
Who could it be?  
I hope its you  
It's you, oh  
  
Then again, then again, then again  
You're always first when  
No one's on your side  
Then again, then again, then again  
The day has come and  
I want off that ride

"A certain shade of green,  
Tell me, is that what you need?  
All signs around say move ahead.  
Could someone please explain to me your ever present  
Lack of speed?  
  
Are your muscles bound by ropes?  
Or do crutches cloud your day?  
My sources say the road is clear,  
And street signs point the way.  
Are you gonna stand around till 2012 A.D.?  
  
What are you waiting for,  
A certain shade of green?  
I think I grew a gray watching you procrastinate.  
What are you waiting for,  
A certain shade of green?  
  
Would a written invitation  
Signed, ""Choose now or lose it all,""  
Sedate your hesitation?  
Or inflame and make you stall?  
You've been raised in limitation,  
But that glove never fit quite right.  
  
The time has come for hand-me-downs,  
Choose anew, please evolve,  
Take flight  
What are you waiting for?  
A written invitation?  
A public declaration?  
A private consolation?

With the coldest of weapons, confidence

This cloud we're hovering on

On a wire connecting our hearts  
There's a string, and it's tied  
To a kite  
There's a storm in the sky  
Now the clouds become electric  
There you are, here I am

Feeling cheaper than usual

You don't you know me half as well as you think you do  
I don't owe anything

The plastic hanging from my ear  
And in that moment I went unfazed  
So take what you can while you can  
Less conscious only means more gold  
I could snap at any moment and remember  
I was not born to be sold

Oars freed from their homes long ago  
Lying face up on the floor  
Of my vessel  
I marvel at the stars  
And feel my heart overflow  
  
Further down the river  
  
Two weeks without my lover  
I'm in this boat alone  
Floating down a river named emotion  
Will I make it back to shore?  
Or drift into the unknown  
  
Further down the river  
  
I'm building an antenna  
Transmissions will be sent  
When I am through  
Maybe we can meet again  
Further down the river  
And share what we both discovered  
Then revel in the view  
  
Further down the river

Moving objects

But they don't the real horrors  
Behind the spirit of the dead  
Ceremony is over now  
Relatives left in satisfaction  
Knowing that he's resting in eternal peace  
Days have passed  
Then there was a knocking at the door  
Live in the flesh  
The missing one that they thought was dead  
Memories coming back  
Realizing what they have heard  
Was nothing but a malignant force  
Telling them nothing but lies

And spare the lives of some twenty-six nervous eyes  
Being occupied by the little red numbers passing by?

Guilty running free as the victims are suffering  
From the fact that there is no escape  
Feeling that their security is not strong enough yet  
Thefts, rapes, murders growing to a numerous rate

Is the economy provoking it  
Or is it just the ignorant side of a human being

To those individual warriors  
Where each man is like a country  
Fighting each other in a conventional war  
Mandatory action of survival

Like an epidemic without any curse  
We will never learn from our mistakes  
The more we stop, the more will emerge  
The experience are the lesson to make us fear

"We're given a garden  
And gave back a parking lot  
We got about fifteen minutes to go  
Before this audience  
Starts throwing tomatoes, yeah  
It?s not the end, there is more show  
We got about fifteen minutes to go

Just peeked our heads above the mud  
No one?s immune, deafening bells  
My God, will we survive ourselves?  
I'm not an alarmist  
But someone should break the glass  
And pull that red T-lever down  
To get their attention  
Start lobbing the light grenades  
That burst and blind them with the truth  
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth  
Survived the plague, floated the flood  
Just peeked our heads above the mud  
No one?s immune, deafening bells  
My God, will we survive ourselves?  
Survived the plague, floated the flood  
Just peeked out heads above the mud  
Wipe off your face, we've come this far

Left brain, left out on the wire  
  
You make me happy  
You magnify my better half  
You make me certain  
That all I have today is your photograph  
  
My past is perilous  
And each scar I bear sings  
Monuments to where I have been  
And melodies to where I am going

Saying my name  
Saying to me  
Saying to me

"Alone in their destination  
Wandering thru this violent life  
A part of all misconception from their past  
And now thrown out to the street to rot  
Painful screams never heard  
Hung on the wings of death  
Germs are what they seem  
For the rich they have no need  
Left in the cold in crucial places  
Feeling the horrors of real life  
Places to places, no where to go  
Agonizing pain and no one seems to care  
Trying to revive 'em for a higher place  
But no one seems to give any support  
They hear their torment call  
Disarmed from an endless war  
Aimed by all kinds of poverty  
Vagabonds you will find in types of societies  
Resting in the underground of this materialistic  
Inferno  
Chorus  
Mortify  
In hostility of human injustice  
Some say that they're not concerned  
But never willing to take their burdens  
Let's hope it's not your skin  
Which is rotting of sins  
Chorus  
Mortify  
In hostility of human injustice  
They are living in a world of darkness  
In which the light seems far away  
No justice  
Blamed for someone else's deed  
Humiliation  
Because they are poor  
Treated harshly  
Is this what they call the advancement of mankind  
Why men want to rule the space  
While they can't even solve the problems of the earth  
Where is our humane sense now  
So much said, but so little done  
Blinded and devoured by our greed  
Facing all the worries of our minds  
We can't feel what is happening in the world around us  
Turbulence is the conflict which we all must face  
Crossing the line of stupidity and discrimination  
Is one of the reasons which makes us ignore  
The actual state of the moribund  
Breaking down their hope to piece  
Destitution increases in front of their own miserable lives  
Chorus  
Mortify  
In hostility of human injustice  
Days passed  
Injured ones dying fast  
Harsh temperatures  
The whips of cold winds  
Are frosting their bodies on the attack  
Feeling the rigor mortis stage alive  
Reaching to the ultimate muscular paralysis

"At first I see an open wound  
infected and disastrous  
It breathes chaotic catastrophe  
it cries to be renewed  
Its tears are the color of anger,  
they dry to form a scab  
To the touch, its stiff and resilient,  
underneath, the new skin breathes  
As outwardly cliche as it may seem,  
yes, something under the surface says,  
""C'est la vie""  
It is a circle, there is a plan  
dead skin will atrophy itself to start again  
Look closely at the open wound  
see past what covers the surface  
Underneath chaotic catastrophe,  
creation takes stage.  
Its all been saved  
with exception for the right parts  
When will we be new skin?  
Its all been seen with exception for what could be  
When will we be new skin?  
Fallacious cognitions  
spewed from televisions  
do mold our decisions.  
So stop and take a look,

With all those chemicals, wars and destructions  
We do not know what mother nature has in store for us

Makes people forget  
The lives around this planet

That the forces of nature has brought  
The droughts, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions  
It's getting worse than ever before

Causing death rate and we wonder from where

Because of drought  
Occurrences of flooding everywhere  
Killing innocent people and leaving others in despair  
Abomination because people fear that all these events  
Happen without any warning killing unexpectedly  
Men subjugate the forces of nature  
But we don't know that it's destroying us slowly  
The animals are becoming extinct  
Seas and rivers polluted by toxic waste  
Combustible smoke  
Factories are creating acid rains  
That is burning our skins, damaging plantations  
And soon it will us to death  
Air pollution is disintegrating our atmosphere  
Allowing the ultra-violet rays to burn the earth  
Ad to provoke us fear

Won't exist anymore  
Because we won't be able to recreate  
Some of the beauty that we had before  
Nobody seems to care  
About the future of our children's civilizations  
We better act now  
So they won't have a life of torment and frustration  
Stupidity  
Causing pain  
Punishment for violating  
The ecologic balance

By eliminating our source of life  
When blindly we continue the destructions  
There's no future  
Day by day we are reaching the end of our lives

"Alone in my house  
Full of hate and fear  
Your death is near  
My passion for killing will take you to death  
I slay a victim I torture his wife  
They die by my knife  
I'm coming for you  
So take your last breath  
The more I kill, the more the need grows  
I dislodge the eyes and hack off the nose

I'm a sadistic sinner  
I will slash you at will  
It is the devil inside me  
Who makes me wanna kill  
Evil  
And you will die by my hand  
Killer  
And I'll make you understand  
Possessed  
Just like the knife in my hand  
Killer  
He taunts my soul and he twists my mind  
The blood of my victims is all they can find  
I dismember the body as its blood is being sprayed  
I gaze in splendor at the mess I have made  
Cold is the blade  
I carry in rage  
They live in fear  
My passion for killing will take you to death  
My soul is a demon that no one can save  
I spread my disease  
I'm coming for you  
So take your last breath  
The more I kill, the more the need grows  
I dislodge the eyes and hack off the nose

Not to conquer, but to share in the view.  
You're a bonfire and I'm gathered 'round you.

Set it aflame, send it away  
Set it aflame, send it away  
Set it aflame, send it away

"Modern world men  
Blinded by technology  
Using the Lord's words  
For their own material needs  
Stealing the goods  
From the faithful ones  
Evangelists in suits  
Dominating their thoughts  
And souls thrown in blasphemy  
They don't know about the truth  
But they try to convince you  
[CHORUS]  
I wonder how God can resist  
Using his words like this  
Speaking the holy words  
But in a different way, in terror  
They teach'em not to be saved  
But leading them to an error, leaving'em unsafe  
Malignant force are speaking  
Through the false prophets  
They don't know that an evil spirit  
Can take a preacher's soul  
[LEAD]  
[LEAD]  
A fucking organization determined to rule the world  
Preparing those for their supreme evil one  
Ask for good help, now  
Before it's too late, you all  
After they steal your soul they even take your money away  
Trying to put all other religion down  
Like if them all was in vain  
Satan is draining their souls  
And they can't feel it  
They are all blind now  
'cause they left their true religion  
Each day their legion  
Is growing more and stronger  
Pretty soon there'll be  
No one left to survive  
Innocent people looking for guidance  
They don't know who they're messing with  
[CHORUS]  
I wonder how God can resist  
Using his words like this  
Taking the Bible to make a profit  
They can't escape from the blaspheming prophets

"I don't want to talk to you anymore  
I'm afraid of what I might say  
I bite my tongue every time you come around  
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood off the ground  
  
Hand over my heart I swear,  
I've tried everything I could within all my power  
2 weeks and 1 hour  
I slaved and now I've got nothing to show  
Oh if only you've grown taller than a brick wall  
From now on  
Gonna start holding my breath  
When you  
Come around and you flex that fake grin  
Cause something inside me has said more than twice  
That breathing this air  
Beats breathing you at all  
  
I don't want to talk to you anymore  
I'm afraid of what I might say  
I bite my tongue every time you come around  
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood off the ground  
  
Hand over my mouth  
I'm earning the right to my silence  
In quiet discerning between ego and timing  
Good judgment is once again proving to me  
That its still worth its weight in gold  
From now on I'm gonna be so much more weary  
When you start to speak and my warm blood starts to boil  
Seeing you is like pulling teeth  
And hearing your voice is like chewing tin foil  
  
I don't want to talk to you anymore  
I'm afraid of what I might say  
I bite my tongue every time you come around  
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood off the ground  
  
I'm fast to a better judgment  
By saying less today  
I will gain more, gain more  
No tears to you my, my fickle friend  
You you brought the art of silent war  
  
I don't want to talk to you anymore  
I'm afraid of what I might say  
I bite my tongue every time you come around  
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood off the ground

"On my way home, police car pulled me over.  
After they left, I puttered out of gas.  
Triple-A' came, but my card was expired!  
I had to walk home, and of course, it rained half the time.  
I tried to get some shut-eye, then I was abducted!  
  
They put cold things in my butt.  
They sampled a bit of my D.N.A.  
They left me on top of my sheets,  
I dreamt I went potty, then woke up drenched in me.  
This day sucked the hardest ever  
  
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today.  
A little bit less than nothing would go my way.  
I got up to toss my soiled sheets,  
the hallway was dark and I stubbed my big toe.  
It was then that I sensed the irony (burning me),  
then I heard the voice say,  
""Come sail aboard S.S. Nepenthe!""  
  
I suppose I'm to blame for getting pulled over.  
I guess I'm the culprit for running out of gas.  
Let's assume I'm the guy who didn't pay his 'Triple-A' fee.  
In actuality, I let the zetas probe me.  
Yesterday was all my fault.  
  
I let negativity get the better of me.  
Thank goodness for the bathtubs and suds!

Hey what would it mean to you?  
To know that it'll come back around again  
Hey whatever it means to you  
Know that everything moves in circles  
  
I saw you standing in my headlights Blink blink blink  
I thought Id run you down for the weight you left on me  
But then I pressed rewind, reversed and drove away  
And see you, disappear in my rear view  
Brought to me the word reciprocity  
  
Hey what would it mean to you?  
To know that it'll come back around again  
Hey whatever it means to you  
Know that everything moves in circles

We fall on and we fall off

"Lyrics for Hunger For Power  
Performed by Incubus  
Rational human beings irrational in other ways  
Betraying each other in an unfriendly race  
All they do is think for themselves  
Ask them for some help and they'll tell you to go to Hell  
Welcome to the brutal world  
Vehemence, the way it goes  
Rejoicing for the disgrace of the successful one  
The jealousy is the weapon of the incompetent bum  
So if you think you've got your best frined  
You better look back, you never know what he might do next  
The anger is built in silence  
It's gonna cause some ignorant violence  
That's a goal rule number one  
To achieve in command  
What they've done in the past  
You're gonna let'em pay back  
I wonder why you do to others  
What you don't want them doing to you  
If prejudice has a value in life  
Evil would rule you too  
Remember for all the bad things you commit  
You're gonna pay with the same coin, you damn fool  
Breaking the barrier between patience and rage  
That are controlling you  
Now you're feeling what your best friend was going through  
That's the way the circle of life  
Has been for many years ago people are so greedy  
When they're in trouble, they look for you  
You can't lose this society battle  
Evil plans are coming to your mind  
To fight back, a sabotage  
That has happened many times  
CHORUS  
Hunger for power  
When you die  
All you have  
Won't go with you  
Hunger for power  
Stupid fight  
You better stand straight  
Or you might fall  
CHORUS  
Hunger for power  
You'll never know  
What might happen  
To us all  
Hunger for power  
When you die  
All you have  
Won't go with you

"To see you when I wake up  
Is a gift I didn't think could be real  
  
To know that you feel the same as I do

So would I be out of line if I said  
I miss you?  
  
I see your picture  
I smell your skin on the empty pillow next to mine  
  
You have only been gone ten days

Let you see past the feathers and flocks,

In the company of wolves I sat in silence  
Observant and afraid

Oh oh, something's wrong, something's wrong,

There's just one parachute  
Goodbye Erica now I see  
That my worst fears were in tune  
  
It's not who you were  
It's who you are  
And we've come this far lover

"Bowing down to an angle cast out by God  
Worshipping a deceitful enemy  
Who's laughing at their pride in following him  
Considering everyone to be merely human pigs  
Under his cunning and evil eyes

A multitude is in total chaos  
Knowing not the deceived ones that they are  
Asking for power, richness and desire  
The price that they must pay  
Is their souls thrown into a cauldron of fire  
By being weak and blind  
The fools disrespect the Christian houses of God  
They are the opposite of all that is Holy  
Locked in cages of sins  
How can they reject the creator of all living things  
The almighty God hears the prayers from Holy priests  
And Christians alike, forgiveness for them in at hand  
But curses shall fall upon those that refuse to repent  
God's only begotten son was scoured, mocked and put  
To death and resurrected on the third day  
Proved his powers to demonstrative  
How goodness always prevails  
Followers of damnation march on in their darkest ways  
Failing to see and admit the truth that Christ left for  
Us today

"The evening began as a positive swaret  
And my abode was 4-2-0 G.  
But little did I know that in the very next apartment  
There'd be trouble on the brew for me!  
Ubiquitous I wish I could be  
Because the clock cuts short my own day!  
  
One hundred things to do before I rest my sore ass  
Upon the cushion that supports my array!  
Can this be?  
Trouble!  
So if I may, slip you a tip.  
You'd best stay away from 4-2-1.  
Trouble!  
  
So get high the green way.  
So get by the green way, yes!  
I knocked upon their door  
In hopes of bidding them their welcome  
And instead I was caught by an eye.  
His pupil was wide open  
  
Kinda like a liquor barn at 3:00.  
It was indoubadoubly dose derived.  
It was then that they took me  
And shined their light between my eyes.  
  
He said ""What are ya new?  
Why are you here? What's the catch?  
Why not explain in clear? Why you're peaking around?""  
I wish I could've just kept to my own.  
  
My hospitality has been too well spent and I've paid my rent!  
I should've kept my thoughts, on who might've been inside  
So that my mind could sit and delude my pride!  
I beg my common sense to keep my  
Neighbor out away from my front door  
  
Until I find a way  
To hide myself from those in 4-2-1, one  
..one away from the good one.

Is asleep on its feet.

Leaving us as vitamins  
For the hibernating human animal.

You stare at me like a vitamin  
On the surface you hate,  
But you know you need me.  
  
I'll come dressed as any pill you deem fit.  
Whatever helps you swallow truth  
All the more easily.  
  
And I wonder, will you digest me?  
Into the sleep machine I won't plug in,  
In fact I'd rather die before I will comply.  
To you, my friend,

Coming closer to another 2000 years
