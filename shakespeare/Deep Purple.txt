Autumn colours, summer's daughter  
And as as the year is growing older  
I see winter on my shoulder  
I stand in the haze  
Watching stormy ripples grow on my own  
Never knew your needed

Slowly drowning, such a sad face  
If only I could change the seasons  
Like a poet, I've my reasons  
It started to snow in the middle of July  
Wonder why  
Never did understand you  
My sorrow is hanging in the grey sky  
  
In the summer days we flew to the sun  
On melting wings  
But the seasons changed to fast  
Leave us all behind  
Blind  
  
But then the stone fell on the water  
Putting end to summer's daughter  
And me, I turn away remembering  
All the seasons, such a sad thing  
It started to rain in the middle of the sun  
Winter's begun  
  
Never did understand you

A time of desperate need

Fighting the anger, jealousy and greed

Someone's laughter out in the street  
fills the night with their loving

Running its hands through my bed  
Not even dreaming I seem to be dead  
Colours of yellow and colours of red

Is to lead me to darkness  
  
I'm so tired, dawn never comes  
I just hide in the shadows

Two-tone Annie drew up battle plans for making love not war  
Everybody laughed at the fighting in the streets and behind the garden door  
It came to nothing when it all went down and the band began to play  
Another plan put your head in the sand live to fight another day  
  
Up the revolution we're all prepared to die  
Up the revolution that was the battle cry  
  
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
There's gonna be Hell

"When I was younger, so much younger than today  
I never needed anybody's help in any way  
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured  
Now I find I've changed my mind, opened up the door  
  
Help me if you can I'm feeling down,  
But I do appreciate your being 'round  
Help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you please help me?  
  
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways  
My independence seems to vanish in the haze  
But every now and then I feel so insecure  
Now I know I need you like I've never done before  
  
Help me if you can I'm feeling down,  
But I do appreciate your being 'round me  
Help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you please help me, my love?  
  
(Help) I need somebody  
(Help) Not just anybody  
(Help) I need someone  
  
Won't you please help me, my love?

"Called to Madonna  
To give me a line  
She said boy what have you done  
Passing your time with a holy man  
Talking about the moon and sun  
But I can't tell the difference  
Between the fool and wise  
Show me a river to follow  
Away from all these lies  
  
I've been on my own so long  
Won't you lend me your hand  
I've been picking up my bones too long  
Won't you understand  
  
Called to the captain  
To put me ashore  
For it looked like no man's land  
Is this the way to follow  
I cried as I shook his hand  
He told me had no answer  
He didn't really hold the key  
I am a simple man  
Was all he said to me  
  
I've been on my own so long  
Won't you lend me a hand  
I've been out in the cold too long  
Won't you understand  
I've been on the road so long  
Won't you lend me your hand  
I've been out in the cold too long  
Won't you understand  
  
Heard my mother crying  
She was calling out my name  
Whisper in the dark night  
Saying who's to blame  
The hour glass keeps turning  
With not enough sand to see  
I am a holy man  
So don't you bother me  
  
I've been on my own so long  
Won't you lend me your hand  
I've been pickin' up my bones too long  
Won't you understand  
I've been on my own so long  
Won't you lend me your hand

Waiting 'round for you to call

Ain't got nothing to say  
Just live your life  
The way you know  
When you moved on  
You took all the sweetness  
Was I a fool to let you go  
With the woman I forget for the moment  
All the times we knew before

The same old love song  
I don't want you knocking on my door

Making one last appearance in a heap of old cars  
Brambles and weeds flourishing amongst  
Lines of empty bottles and rambling drunks

Always remind me of home  
  
Once of a dozen covered with stains  
Blistered and stinking was all that remained  
Cannibalized machines, mysterious bones  
Unwanted contents of anonymous homes  
  
Those junkyard blues sounds familiar  
Take me back  
Always remind me of home  
  
Mangy old dog scratching in the dust  
Burned out Mercedes surrendering to rust  
All this stuff was good for something  
But here it is now, good for nothing

I'm never alone  
Always remind me of home

A master of many tongues

From her Austin to her Bentley  
Suddenly she feels so young

Don't care where I go  
I never seem to know  
I never had a penny, but I never wondered why  
Oh no, I never wondered why  
  
If I'm cold I need some heat  
If I'm hungry then I eat  
I'm not responsible  
  
I woke up this morning and I couldn't find my shoes  
It's one long party and I haven't seen the sun for days  
I'd take you out tonight, but I'm just a little light  
So let's go out anyway, you'll be amazed  
  
I take my woman to the palace dancing  
I never coulda made it but the doorman is a friend of mine  
So I raise a glass to you, the foot is on the other shoe  
You can pay the bill and while you're at it pick up mine  
Oh, no no, I don't mind  
  
If it rains I stay inside  
If I'm scared I run and hide  
I'm not responsible, oh no

"Cold beer and a strange cigarette

Doing it wrong doing it right just doing it  
You got your life on the one hand  
Mine in the other  
I got the right we all got the right

One man's meat is someone's empty well  
One man's meat is some guy's aching butt  
One man's meat is another man's living hell  
  
Short fat thick or thin  
Take it in the gut take it on the chin  
Living in glory living in sin  
Hard day's work going down slow  
Riding the road where the green grass grows  
Watching in die what d'you know  
Watch it  
You got your life on the one hand  
Mine in the other

His self, his rights, his views  
But never his heart or his love

And let light pass like a wheel  
Don't take the chance of life's hectic dance  
Kiss the strength of the shield  
  
The seeker will be found by the looker on the ground  
And to his wish he will yield  
  
Fate will have it's word, of course

Are you the cat that got the cream  
Did you lick your lips did you close your eyes

Oh I can't get through and I'm falling  
I'm getting out, I'm losing ground  
The Spanish archer's gonna bring you down  
  
is there someone somewhere waiting in the wings  
to take my place  
Let's not drag it out like a Cagney death scene  
In this season of change it's not hard to explain  
Like the leaves on the trees I'm falling  
And as you turn, don't look away  
The Spanish archer's gonna make you pay  
  
Do you remember when the sky was blue  
we used to talk for miles  
And now we drive along in this thundering silence  
It's such an obvious lie with that easy smile of yours  
I'm letting go and I'm falling  
I'm getting out, losing ground  
The Spanish archer's gonna bring you down  
  
Well is there something I can say as we stumble to the edge have we gone too
far  
Why don't we call it a day before we call it a nightmare darlin'  
If we made a mistake then all that it takes to be free  
Is the wave of a hand and you're falling  
And as you turn, don't look away  
The Spanish archer's gonna make you pay

Believe it's gonna be a big mistake  
But I'm tempted to believe in you  
  
I don't want to run and I don't want to fight  
I just want to be the one you love tonight  
Unclose my eyes, let it be  
  
Bring on the band of angels from the great divide  
I'll never get to heaven so take me for a ride  
Fruit on the tree is shaking, my mind is in a daze  
I just want a taste of your love  
And learn your wicked ways  
  
You're so bad, it feels good  
There's so much I never understood  
Oh Mama take a look at me now  
I'm hung up, strung out  
All I want to do is scream and shout your name  
Addicted to you somehow  
  
Electric in your touch there's magic in your kiss  
You know I never knew that love could feel like this  
Unclose my eyes, set me free  
  
Bring on the band of angels from the great divide  
I'll never get to heaven so take me for a ride  
Fruit on the tree is shaking, my mind is in a daze  
I just want a taste of your love

While jackals in the shadows  
Manoeuvre for position  
  
A fundament of righteous men  
A barrow ideals  
The carriage of misjustice  
Crushes all beneath it's wheels  
Conspiracies of silence  
Within the temple walls  
Graveyards full of promises

A castle full of rascals  
A fortress full of thieves  
A parliament of silver tongues  
That latter to deceive

To walk behind here

Gets you strong for crying out loud.

Go racing by tearing up the street

Take it easy and rest my feet  
  
Don't worry  
You know, there's no hurry  
Here we are  
With all the time in the world  
  
No-one ever held me back  
You know that no-one ever put me in chains  
No-one ever saw me racing ahead  
No-one had to tug on my reins  
  
As everybody knows  
I may be slow but I never quit  
Sometimes on a good day I sit and think  
Sometimes I just sit  
  
Don't worry  
Relax, there's no hurry  
Here we are

You always know where I'll be found  
Hanging somewhere near the ground  
Help me up or help me down  
  
Don't want to lose those days  
When everything is just a haze  
I'm dreaming  
  
I believe I could walk before I learned to crawl  
When I look up, the Devil's looking back  
From the mirror on the wall  
You can open the door  
Got my feet stuck to the floor  
I may have lost my way  
But I didn't get where I am today  
  
Don't want to lose those days  
When everything is just a haze

Then you might just appear  
Even though you'd soon be gone

Take my hand and brush my brow  
In the warm and fevered dark  
Heart is madly beating  
My crazy thoughts are burning

College cream, it always emerges

You always sleep with a smile on your face  
Much as I want to put myself in your place  
Not my business I've got dreams of my own  
I try to recall but when I wake up it's gone  
  
Don't let go of that image  
You'll never see it again  
  
I can hear voices they're buzzing in my head  
Eyebrows raised was it something I said  
A long hot night, it crept in like a thief  
The engine stopped, the seat belt popped  
And her jaw dropped in disbelief  
  
Don't let go of that beast

Your footprints in the dirt

Gone they've taken everything

Tuning up to madness in the back room

"You came along for a weekend  
But you only stayed for one night  
You took off your hair, you pulled out your teeth  
Oh I almost died of fright  
  
You'd better do something for your own sake  
Yes it's a shame  
Ah you know you're a living wreck  
  
You said you were a virgin  
Full of promise and mystery  
But I knew that you would bring me down  
'Cos everyone calls you big G  
  
You'd better do something for your own sake  
Yes it's a shame  
Ah you know you're a living wreck  
  
You said you're gonna love me  
You said you're gonna set me free  
But I knew that you would bring me down  
And cause me misery  
  
You'd better do something for your own sake  
Yes it's a shame  
Ah you know you're a living wreck

"Wake up in the morning  
Get into bed  
Closing my eyes  
I rest my head  
  
There is no arrangement  
No time no place  
It's gone in the wind  
And left no trace  
  
Who can say,  
maybe or whatever.  
It's up to you  
You know you can trust me  
I'll make it up to you  
  
You move with the action  
You loosen my strings  
Your fingers can smooth out my jangles  
And all those things  
  
Grease on the handle  
and the tangles in my hair  
They always seem to go together  
I don't care

"You can walk through fire  
Make the north wind blow  
Squeeze 'n' tease me honey

You move my soul  
Let me be your lover  
Won't you let me be your child  
Take me through your universe  
Ya'know that when you smile  
You drive me wild  
  
Love child  
Driving me wild  
Love child  
Always teasin' me  
  
You can ride your pony  
Day dream in fairy tales  
All I know is I need more  
When I see you dance the seven veils

"Feels like the end  
When you're closer to losing your dreams  
Than losing a friend  
Flying blind  
I'm shooting into the dark  
Who will I find?  
Oh girl  
And if it takes me a lifetime  
I swear I'll tear down every wall  
Love conquers all  
  
On my way  
Tomorrow I rise with the sun  
Soon I'll be gone  
Words can't say  
How the memories of feelings of love  
They linger on  
Oh girl  
And if it takes me forever  
I know it's worth every teardrop that falls  
Love conquers all  
  
Somewhere there's a place in your heart  
Where the wounds never heal  
Well you're not alone  
That's just how I feel  
  
Love conquers all  
This one will last a lifetime  
And if love conquers all  
This one will last forever

"If I work hard every day  
For my money  
If I work my finger down to the bone  
That ain't funny  
Now if I see  
Something I can't buy  
I put a dollar down  
Then I try try try  
To get my money  
I need my money  
A woman who ain't got a dime  
I can't use her no  
If she ain't got no cash money  
I've got to refuse her  
I need a woman  
With a whole lotta will  
So she help me, baby  
Help me pay my bill  
I need my money  
I've got to have money  
  
I need lovin' to give me a livin'  
So don't ask me I don't need forgivin'  
I will stand up to count the cost  
But I know I won't stand the loss  
  
I need a woman  
With a whole lotta will  
She can help me pay my bill  
I need my money  
I want my money  
Before I say my prayers  
I count my money  
When I wake up  
It has to be there  
My money  
You see, love, it don't mean a thing  
When she loves you  
She can't bring, can't bring you no money  
I've got to have my money  
  
Lookin' for lovin'  
I need a livin'

"Vibrant flashes in my mind  
Remind me of a foregone time

Blackened faces

With memories of a love that's dead  
Sometimes happy then sad  
I need love, love help me

Memories that are only mine  
Looking for love, a brand new love  
Looking for love  
  
Dreams that are hard to see  
Finding a new love for me  
Someday she must come along  
I need love, love help me  
  
I need love to come home  
Somewhere there must be one  
  
Hoping someday for good news  
Waiting for that girl to choose  
Only hoping, all I can do  
Only hoping  
  
One day she must come along  
A girl as pretty as a song  
A woman just meant for me

"Mary Long is a hypocrite  
She does all the things that she tells us not to do  
Selling filth from a corner shop  
And knitting patterns to the high street queue  
She paints roses, even makes them smell good  
And then she draws titties on the khazy wall  
Drowns kittens just to get a thrill  
And writes sermons in the Sunday Chronicle  
  
How did you lose your virginity, Mary Long?  
When will you lose your stupidity, Mary Long?  
  
Mary told Johnny not to write such trash  
Said it was a waste of public money  
She made a fuss, they made apologies  
But everybody thought the show was funny  
When the nation knew you'd had children  
It came as such a surprise  
We really didn't know you'd had it in you  
How you did it we can only surmise  
  
How did you lose your virginity, Mary Long?  
When will you lose your stupidity, Mary Long?  
  
Mary Long, you're not alone  
But you're a long way behind our times  
What we do in full frontal view  
Is more honest than your clean-up mind  
What I'm saying, Mary Long is  
When you can spare a minute  
Go find your friend the porny Lord  
Dig your self a hole and jump in it  
  
How did you lose your virginity, Mary Long?  
When will you lose your stupidity, Mary Long?

Where you going boy

"I was young and healthy  
Extremely wealthy  
I swung in the trees  
And did as I pleased  
I thought I was rich  
Oh yeah  
Such sweet seduction  
I could feel the suction  
Greasing my palm  
And doing no harm  
Just making some deals  
What a bitch  
  
Money talks to me  
Whispers in my ear  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want  
  
I had rising stock  
So I got more pockets  
I knew somewhere to stick it  
Where no-one would nick it  
I kinda went private  
And then, aha  
Such sweet seclusion  
No more intrusion  
Too much food on my plate  
But there's guards at the gate  
Such joy  
I could almost die of it  
  
Money talks to me  
Lays it on the line  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want  
  
Money goes to money  
Yes it always returns  
Finds its way back to the big house  
Where it lives all alone  
Wraith like silent partners  
Operators of the system  
Give words of quiet assurance  
To an otherwise healthy victim  
  
It's all coming back to me  
I would swing in the trees  
And I'd swim in the ocean  
I used to show some emotion  
  
I was not to blame  
I feel no shame  
The structure was shaking  
Was there for the taking  
I had the resources  
But then, oh no  
Someone outbid me  
I can't take it with me?  
Then I will devour it  
I can't go without it  
It's simply a question of  
Market forces  
  
Money talks to me  
Whispers in my ear  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want  
Money talks to me  
Laughs right in my face  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want

"I was driving through the night  
Into an endless tunnel of fog  
When it dawned on me something was wrong  
I was in a trance, hypnotized  
Bored beyond belief  
I was listening to the same old song  
I know every lick, every word  
Every nuance  
I'm on first name terms with the crew  
But I'd better get used to this poop du jour  
Sure as hell they won't play anything new  
  
Oh yes I love you really

Oh my dear it's time for bed  
Time for you to go  
Everyone is asleep  
  
The pirates took to water, stole the charts  
But sadly that didn't go down well with those upstairs  
Who require loyalty  
The establishment considered  
That the uncontrolled appreciation of music  
Was a danger to royalty  
The mighty empire roared  
As Cash 'n' Everett on the high seas  
Looked like they'd get blown out of the water  
They did of course eventually come ashore  
As meek as mice or to be more accurate  
As lambs to the slaughter  
  
Oh yes I love you really  
I stand to attention  
Oh Fanny, I love you dearly  
Something else I should mention?  
You sweet thing

I don't even want to start  
I want to take a look at Classic Rock Radio  
We're talking about the state of the art

You musta made a million  
The night that Frank Zappa caught on fire  
Could you tell us all about it  
Keep it short and use my version  
Or everyone out there'll think I'm a liar  
We can speak about Bananas for one second  
Just because I understand  
You have to get them off your chest  
But in the meantime while your talking  
Could you do some more of these here ID's  
And then this station might maintain some interest  
  
Oh yes I love you dearly  
But why do you exist?  
Oh yes I love you really  
Is there something that I missed?

Oh oh oh so good  
Oh it feels so good  
  
We're all the same but then again  
We're all quite different in our own peculiar ways  
We've come so far and now we're going through another phase

I can't stand living this way  
Getting by from day to day

When something spiritual has taken place  
We don't know why we don't know how  
We've been transformed into a state of grace  
But it's alright  
We walk in our sleep  
Yes it's alright

Only one thing I can do

"There's a full time reservation  
Made in a bar at the railway station.  
And there's a story, a kind of fable,  
On a card at the corner table.  
On it is a message, been there some time.  
It starts off, ""The coffee tasted so fine""  
It says, ""One day, this may find you,  
These few words may just remind you.  
We sat here together just to pass time,  
You said how the coffee tasted so fine. ""  
It goes on to say, ""I love you.  
If you should find this I must hear from you. ""  
It gives a number but the name has faded away.  
All that is left are just the words, ""Maybe someday""  
That's the story and the fable,  
Never leave alone from a corner table.  
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo,  
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo, doo doo.

"Got your finger on the trigger  
Your cold eyes taking aim  
You took a shot at my heart  
Let the bullets fly  
Tell me has one of them got my name?  
  
What about the heartache  
What about the emptiness inside  
It doesn't just fade away  
Turning the knife  
How much can I bleed  
The cut runs deep  
  
I can't find no salvation  
Can't find no healing touch  
Reaching out for mercy  
A stranger in your eyes  
I want you too much

Turning the knife  
How much can I bleed

"Tell me gypsy can you see me  
In your crystal ball  
I'm asking you what can I do  
My back's against the wall  
And I can't hold on much longer  
So I've come to you my friend  
For now my life seems at an end  
  
I came to see you once before  
One hundred years ago  
You took my hand and broke the spell  
That should have let me go  
But my years have gone so slowly  
So I'm here again my friend  
For now my life is at an end

"Listen to me...  
I've got a warning for you  
You've got to learn to take more care  
'Cause if you swim in dirty water  
  
Be careful how you dry your hair  
In a room within a room  
In a hole within a hole  
You've got to learn to share your secrets  
Or you'll lose your soul  
  
I've got the evidence  
I know you broke  
The unwritten law  
Another town, another one night stand  
You know, you broke the law...  
  
It's so hard to hold back  
When the fire is in your eyes  
A silver dollar in my pocket  
I don't like surprises  
  
I've got your souvenir  
Is that the price I've got to pay?  
It ain't been that long  
Since the last charade  
  
I've got the evidence  
I know you broke  
The unwritten law  
Another town, another one night stand  
You know, you broke the law...  
  
I know you're guilty  
But I'm carrying the blame  
I took out much more than I put in  
And I felt the pain  
In a dirty little room  
With nowhere left to hide  
You told the truth with your eyes  
But you lied inside  
  
I've got the evidence  
I know you broke  
The unwritten law  
Another town, another one night stand  
You know, you broke the law...

"Don't get me started, let's get it right  
There's no use to talk about it deep into the night  
Don't ask about secrets I could tell  
I'm gonna keep them to myself  
  
No bad decisions, no good advice  
No time to think about it even once or twice  
No second chances looking down the road  
When there's the only way, only way to go  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What's going on inside my head  
Well could it be the pressure that I'm under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
I can't remember, I can't forget  
Take it from me there's not a moment of regret  
Since the day I learned to tie my shoes  
I found it hard to spread the news  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What's going on inside my head  
Well could it be the pressure that I'm under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
It's hard to swallow, it's hard to take  
When I think about it now my knees begin to shake  
Never came to me to mention at the time  
Tell the truth it never crossed my mind  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What's going on inside my head  
Well could it be the pressure that I'm under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What's going on inside my head  
Could it be the pressure that I'm under  
Makes me forget the things I never said

To pay the cost would never be the same  
Eternal lovers we're not to blame  
There's no mistake there's no refrain

"Consider your position position your defense  
Why don't you let me ask you is it mere coincidence  
Feeding speculators on a downhill gravy train  
Like vultures ripping out the eyes to reach the dying brain  
Listen to the wind - a silent scream  
Tearing at your broken heart  
Like a forgotten dream  
  
And there's a time for peace a time for war  
Wondering what we've been put here for  
A time for giving a time to take  
A time for love and a time for hate  
A time for beg and a time to steal  
So you gamble on that spinning wheel  
Of all these things I've had my fill  
Lord I need some time to kill  
  
Ten percent of nothing is exactly what you got  
You thing you've got the given right to take another shot  
I'll take away your money all you've got is colored beads  
Find a piece of land where you can sow your seeds  
Listen to the wind - a silent scream  
Tearing at your broken heart  
Like a forgotten dream  
  
There's a time for passion a time for pain  
A time to learn that we're all the same  
A time to remember a time to forget  
Wondering how we're going to pay our debts  
A time for thunder a time for rain  
Waiting for the seasons to change  
Of all these things I've had my fill  
Lord I need some time to kill

Under command  
We're ordered to die or take this land  
  
Stupid bastards and religious freaks  
So safe in their castle keeps  
They turn away as a mother weeps  
Under the gun  
  
When brave men fall  
Under crimson skies  
There's a sadness reflected in a soldier's eyes  
Tears will dry  
For those I kill  
Remember no more their names but someone will  
  
The only way to be victorious  
Screw the fools who think it's glorious  
Who gives a toss about the likes of us?  
Under the gun

"Playing pool and drinking beer  
Nothin' more'n the  
Occasional tear  
But this man's life goes on  
And he gets  
Greased all over  
From time to time  
At the strip joint, where we met  
He said 'Hi, my name is Ted  
See that one over there  
That ball of thunder  
Every time she goes Vavoom,  
I wiggle in my chair  
Can I buy you a beer?  
What a guy  
  
I've had a few myself he said  
But I never quit when I'm ahead  
Too many rules and regulations  
Stupid laws designed by fools behind closed doors  
And another thing I won't discuss is religion  
It always causes a fight  
Vavoom  
There she goes again  
'How does she do that' said Ted  
  
And he told me  
Of those unjustices (that)  
He had suffered in his life  
His wife and kids  
And boss and dogs  
And neighbors  
Raising cain and causing strife  
They were forever whining  
Bleating howling yapping screeching moaning crying  
Vavoom  
He fed them well  
He keep them warm  
  
Thing about Ted  
He didn't really care  
Nothing much got in his hair  
And the beauty of it was  
That he was right  
He was big as a truck  
And fast as a door  
(what's that?)  
He was always right  
  
The banjo player took a hike  
What's that song  
I used to like  
Vavoom  
He was big as a truck  
Fast as a door - Ted

Grown too long

Afraid to meet the dawn
