"She gets the sun in the daytime  
Perfume in the dusk  
And she comes out in the night time  
With the honeysuckle musk  
Because she smells just like a rose  
And she tastes just like a peach  
She got me walking where the wildlife goes  
I'd do anything to reach her  
  
And she was made in heaven  
Heaven's in the world  
Is this just expresso love  
You know I'm crazy for the girl  
  
She call me just to talk  
She's my lover, she's a friend of mine  
She says hey mister you wanna take a walk  
In the wild west end sometime  
And I get trouble with my breathing  
She says boys don't know anything  
But I know what I want  
I want everything  
  
Well I feel so good 'cause I feel so good  
And I feel so good 'cause it feels so right  
I was made to go with my girl  
Like a saxophone was made to go with the night  
  
And she can raise one eyebrow  
Put her hand on my hip  
And I close one eye now  
Sweat on her tip  
And I surrender to the fever  
She love me so tender I got to believe her  
Love? expresso love's alright  
  
I don't want no sugar in it  
Thank you very much  
All wired up on it all fired up on it  
Expresso touch  
Hey maestro expresso  
It's just another one just like the other one  
Hey maestro expresso  
Is this another one just like the other one

"Now warning lights are flashing down at Quality Control  
Somebody threw a spanner and they threw it in a hole  
There's rumors in the loading bay and anger in the town  
Somebody blew the whistle and the walls are closing down  
There's a meeting in the boardroom they're trying to trace the smell  
There's leaking in the washroom there's a stinking personnel  
Somewhere in the corridors someone was heard to sneeze  
'Goodness me could this be Industrial Disease?  
  
The caretaker was crucified for sleeping at his post  
They're refusing to be pacified it's him they blame the most  
The watchdog's got rabies the foreman's got fleas  
And everyone's concerned about Industrial Disease  
There's panic on the switchboard tongues are in knots  
Some come out in sympathy some come out in spots  
Some blame the management some the employees  
Everybody knows it's the Industrial Disease  
  
The work force is disgusted downs tools and walks  
Innocence is injured experience just talks  
Everyone seeks damages and everyone agrees  
That these are 'classic symptoms of a monetary squeeze'  
On ITV and BBC they talk about the curse  
Philosophy is useless, theology is worse  
History boils over there's an economics freeze  
  
Sociologists invent words that mean 'Industrial Disease'  
Doctor Parkinson declared 'I'm not surprised to see you here  
You've got smokers cough from smoking, brewer's droop from drinking beer  
I don't know how you came to get the Betty Davis ease  
But worst of all young man you've got Industrial Disease'  
  
He wrote me a prescription he said 'you are depressed  
But I'm glad you came to see me to get this off your chest  
Come back and see me later - next patient please  
Send in another victim of Industrial Disease'  
I go down to Speaker's Corner I'm thunderstruck  
They got free speech, tourists, police in trucks  
Two men say they're Jesus one of them must be wrong  
There's a protest singer singing a protest song - he says  
They want to have a war to keep their factories  
They want to have a war to keep us on our knees  
They want to have a war to stop us buying Japanese  
They want to have a war to stop Industrial Disease  
They're pointing out the enemy to keep you deaf and blind  
They want to sap your energy, incarcerate your mind  
They give you Rule Brittania, gassy beer, page three  
Two weeks in Espana and Sunday striptease'  
Meanwhile the first Jesus says 'I'd cure it soon  
Abolish Monday mornings and Friday afternoons'  
The other one's out on hunger strike he's dying by degrees  
How come Jesus gets Industrial Disease?

"With all the clarity of dream  
The sky so blue, the grass so green  
The rank and file and the navy blue  
The deep and strong, the straight and true  
  
The blue line they got the given sign  
The belts and boots march forward in time  
The wood and leather the club and shield  
Swept like a wave across the battlefield  
  
Now with all the clarity of dream  
The blood so red, the grass so green  
The gleam of spur on chestnut flank  
The cavalry did burst upon the ranks  
  
Oh the iron will and iron hand  
In England's green and pleasant land  
No music for the shameful scene  
That night they said it had even shocked the queen  
  
Well alas we've seen it all before  
Knights in armor, days of yore  
The same old feasance and the same old crimes  
We haven't changed since ancient times

Starlings are sweeping around crazy shoals  
A girl is there high heeling across the square  
Wind blows around in her hair and the flaqs upon the poles  
Waiting in the crowd to cross at the light  
She looks around to find a face she can like  
  
Church bell clinging on trying to get a crowd for Evensong  
Nobody cares to depend to depend upon the chime it plays  
They're all in the station praying for trains  
Congregation late again  
It's getting darker all the time these flagpole days  
Drunk old soldier he gives her a fright  
He's crazy lion howling for a fight  
  
Strap hanging gunshot sound  
Doors slamming on the overground  
Starlings are tough but the lions are made of stone  
Her evening paper is horror torn  
But there's hope later for Capricorns  
Her lucky stars give her just enough to get her home  
Then she's reading about a swing to the right  
But she's thinking about a stranger in the night  
I'm thinking about the lions tonight  
What happened to the lions

You gotta be on somebody's books  
The lowdown, a picture of your face  
Your injured looks  
The sacred and profane  
The pleasure and the pain  
Somewhere your fingerprints remain concrete  
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street  
  
A ladykiller, regulation tattoo  
Silver spurs on his heels  
Says, what can I tell you, as I'm standing next to you  
She threw herself under my wheels  
Oh it's a dangerous road  
And a hazardous load  
And the fireworks over liberty explode in the heat  
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street  
  
A three-chord symphony crashes into space  
The moon is hanging upside down  
I don't know why it is I'm still on the case  
It's a ravenous town  
And you still refuse to be traced  
Seems to me such a waste  
And every victory has a taste that's bittersweet  
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street

Ride across the river to the other side

It's the same old story with a different name  
Death or glory, it's the killing game  
  
Gonna ride across the river deep and wide  
Ride across the river to the other side  
  
Nothing gonna stop them as the day follows the night  
Right becomes wrong, the left becomes the right

Today in the mountains, tomorrow the world

Stealing down a wrong way street

And a rock and roll dream  
She's making movies on location  
She don't know what it means  
But the music make her want to be the story  
And the story was whatever was the song what it was  
Roller girl don't worry

Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids

She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss  
And in the roar of dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away  
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me
stay  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And I'm just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love

Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades  
In any shooting gallery where promises are made  
To rock away rock away from Cullercoats and Whitley bay out to rock away  
  
And girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did  
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids

Worst hangover that I ever had  
It took six hamburgers and scotch all night  
Nicotine for breakfast just to put me right  
'cause if you want to run cool  
If you want to run cool  
If you want to run cool, you got to run  
On heavy, heavy fuel  
  
My life makes perfect sense  
Lust and food and violence  
Sex and money are my major kicks  
Get me in a fight I like dirty tricks  
'cause if you want to run cool  
Yes if you want to run cool, you got to run  
On heavy, heavy fuel  
  
My chick loves a man who's strong  
The things she'll do to turn me on  
I love the babes, don't get me wrong  
Hey, that's why I wrote this song  
  
I don't care if my liver is hanging by a thread  
Don't care if my doctor says I ought to be dead  
When my ugly big car won't climb this hill  
I'll write a suicide note on a hundred dollar bill  
'cause if you want to run cool  
If you want to run cool  
Yes if you want to run cool, you got to run  
On heavy, heavy fuel

How long has it been  
How long you gonna keep me wondering  
How long before you see  
Stallin' me was wrong  
How long  
  
How long, how long you gonna keep  
Slappin' my hand away  
How long you gonna keep my love at bay  
How long before you're sure  
My love is strong  
How long

Tellin' me you like me fine  
How long until I'm gonna make you mine  
How long before wake up  
And find your good man gone  
How long

Honey, if I had you

Float like a butterfly, sting just like a, just like a bee.

If I had you.

"Harry made a bareback rider proud and free upon a horse  
And a fine coal miner for the NCB that was  
A fallen angel and Jesus on the cross  
A skating ballerina you should have seen her do the skater's waltz  
Some people have got to paint and draw  
Harry had to work in clay and stone  
Like the waves coming to the shore  
It was in his blood and in his bones  
  
Ignored by all the trendy boys in London and in Leeds  
He might as well have been making toys or strings of beads  
He could not be in the gallery  
And then you get an artist says he doesn't want to paint at all  
He takes an empty canvas and sticks it on the wall  
The birds of a feather all the phonies and all of the fakes  
  
While the dealers they get together  
And they decide who gets the breaks  
And who's going to be in the gallery  
No lies he wouldn't compromise  
No junk no bits of string  
  
And all the lies we subsidize  
That just don't mean a thing  
I've got to say he passed away in obscurity  
And now all the vultures are coming down from the tree  
So he's going to be in the gallery.

"I hear the seven deadly sins  
And the terrible twins came to call on you  
The bigger they are babe

On the same old pleasure ground  
Oh and it never rains around here  
It just comes pouring down

So you got profiteers for to help you out  
With friends like that babe  
Good friends you had to do without  
And now they've taken the chains and the gears  
From off your merry-go-round  
Oh and it never rains around here

You say 'i may be guilty yeah that may be true  
But I'd be lying if I said I was to blame  
See we could have been major contenders  
We never got no money no breaks'  
You've got a list of all the major offenders  
You got a list of all their major mistakes  
And he's just standing on the shadows  
Yes and you smile that come-on smile  
Oh I can still hear you say as clear as the day  
'I'd like to make it worth your while'  
  
Ah but it's a sad reminder  
When your organ grinder has to come to you for the rent  
And all you've got to give him  
Is the use of your side-show tent  
Yes and that's all that remains of the years  
Spent doing to rounds  
And it never rains around here  
Well it just comes pouring down  
  
Now you know what they say about beggars  
You can't complain about the rules  
You know what they say about beggars  
You know who's the first to blame his tools  
You never gave a damn about who you pick up  
And leave lying bleeding on the ground  
You screw people over on the way up  
Because you thought that you were never coming down  
And he takes you out in vaudeville valley  
With his hand up smothering your screams  
And he screws you down in tin pan alley  
In the city of a billion dreams

"You walk out on the high wire  
You're a dancer on thin ice  
You pay no heed to the danger  
And less to advice  
Your footsteps are forbidden  
But with a knowledge of your sin  
You throw your love to all the strangers  
And caution to the wind  
  
And you go dancing through doorways  
Just to see what you will find  
Leaving nothing to interfere  
With the crazy balance of your mind  
And when you finally reappear  
At the place where you came in  
You've thrown your love to all the strangers  
And caution to the wind  
  
It takes love over gold  
And mind over matter  
To do what you do that you must  
When the things that you hold  
Can fall and be shattered  
Or run through your fingers like dust

"Your six blade knife can do anything for you  
Anything you want it to  
One blade for breaking my heart  
One blade for tearing me apart  
Your six blade knife-do anything for you  
You can take away my mind like you take away the top of a tin  
When you come up from behind and lay it down cold on my skin  
Took a stone from my soul when I was lame  
Just so you could make me tame  
  
You take away my mind like you take away the top of a tin  
I'd like to be free of it now, I don't want it no more  
I'd like to be free of it now, you know I don't want it no more  
Everybody got a knife it can be just what they want it to be  
A needle a wife or something that you just can't see  
You know it keeps you strong  
Yes and it'll do me wrong  
Your six blade knife, do anything for you.

"Here I am again in this mean old town  
And you're so far away from me  
And where are you when the sun goes down  
You're so far away from me  
  
[Chorus:]  
So far away from me  
So far I just can't see  
So far away from me  
You're so far away from me  
  
I'm tired of being in love and being all alone  
When you're so far away from me  
I'm tired of making out on the telephone  
And you're so far away from me  
  
[Chorus:]  
So far away from me  
So far I just can't see  
So far away from me  
You're so far away from me  
  
And I get so tired when I have to explain  
When you're so far away from me  
See you've been in the sun and I've been in the rain  
And you're so far away from me  
  
[Chorus:]  
So far away from me  
So far I just can't see  
So far away from me  
You're so far away from me

"Well take a look at that  
I made a castle in the sand  
Saying this is where it's at you know  
Couldn't understand now  
If I realised that the chances were slim  
How come I'm so surprised when the tide rolled in  
  
I want to live on solid rock  
I'm gonna live on solid rock  
I want to give I don't want to be blocked  
I'm gonna live on solid rock  
Well I'm sick of potential  
  
I'm sick of vanity now  
I'm sticking to essential reality now  
I don't know what's worse  
Try to make a silk purse  
Living an illusion living in confusion  
Well a house of cards  
Was never built for shock  
  
You could blow it down in any kind of weather  
Now two solid rocks two solid blocks  
You know they're gonna stick  
Yeah they're gonna stick together  
Because the heart that you break  
That's the one that you rely on  
The bed that you make  
That's the one you gotta lie on  
  
When you point your finger 'cause your plan fell through  
You got three more fingers pointing back at you  
I want to live on solid rock  
I'm gonna live on solid rock  
I want to give I don't want to be blocked  
I'm gonna live on solid rock

"Southbound again I don't know if I'm going or leaving home  
Boy got to be moving  
Seems like the boy is bound to roam  
Southbound again got no money I've got no place to go  
That woman's with her lover boy  
Never want to see her face no more  
Every single time I roll across the rolling River Tyne  
I get the same old feeling  
Every time I'm moving down the line  
Southbound again last night I felt like crying  
Right now I'm sick of living  
But I'm going to keep on trying.

Uh-huh, uh-huh (x4)

Y'all been eatin long enough now stop bein greedy  
Just keep it real partner give to the needy  
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait  
Fuck around and I'm go'a bite you and snatch the plate  
  
[dmx]  
I could flip that flow, I could stick that hoe  
I could get that dough, you know I'm with that yo  
And the thing about the shit I came through, I haven't seen  
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's havin dreams  
All nightmares, the light dares to desert me  
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me  
Paranoid, so I strike out at what ever  
The closest thing to me is gonna get it  
But, never will I, can I think death is wrong  
So i'ma keep holdin on til, what's left is gone  
You could put that on my nigga boone  
These other rap cats will give a nigga room  
But if it ccalls for me to force my way in the door  
Headhuntin mother fuckers, stay on the floor  
4-4, that's what I get sick wit rrrrrrr  
Four more, now all this is liquid rrrrrr  
  
[hook x2]  
  
[dmx]  
I thank the lord everyday that I'm blessed with a gift  
I'm the best, so, unless you wanna rest with the stiff  
Don't touch that, uh-uh, leave it alone  
When you walk pass the dog house leave it a bone  
Dogs bite, dogs fight, dogs knife  
Scratch, shake, and hold all night  
So when you hear the arf arf, start runnin  
Cause when you hear the arf arf, I'm comin  
But I don't like drama so I say to myself,  
""keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth  
I want the money and give me the honeys with big asses  
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses""  
I'm broke so i'ma bash his head wide open  
Beggin me to stop but at least he died hopin  
Didn't get his wish, and now he's a dish with a cat  
Two glowin red eyes, everything else is black  
  
[hook x2]  
  
[dmx]  
When the sun is up the gun is up on the shelf  
And all the runners up are thankin me for their help  
Hopin that they not around when it gets dark outside  
Sun's goin down you hear the bark outside  
Locks off the cage, gauge, with the buck shots, faggot  
You've been lucky all day that's when your luck stops  
One drops, and another and another  
Gun pops, go into you and your mother  
When does it all end, I found a friend in a dog  
Cause fuckin wit these cats will send a friend to the morgue  
Many questions, no answers, just stress  
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed  
If you curse and it gets worse as time goes by  
Can't see straight cause I'm so high, why ask why when you know  
Nigga when it's your time to go, you go

"You get a shiver in the dark,  
It's a raining in the park but meantime-  
South of the river you stop and you hold everything  
A band is blowing Dixie, double four time  
You feel alright when you hear the music ring  
  
Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces  
Coming in out of the rain they hear the jazz go down  
Competition in other places  
Uh but the horns they blowin' that sound  
Way on downsouth  
Way on downsouth  
London town  
  
Check out guitar george, he knows-all the chords  
Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make them cry or sing  
They said an old guitar is all, he can afford  
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing  
  
And Harry doesn't mind, if he doesn't, make the scene  
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright  
He can play the honky tonk like anything  
Savin' it up, for Friday night  
With the Sultans  
We're the Sultans of Swing  
  
Then a crowd a young boys they're a foolin' around in the corner  
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles  
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playin' band  
It ain't what they call rock and roll  
Then the Sultans  
Yeah the Sultans they play creole, creole  
  
And then the man he steps right up to the microphone  
And says at last just as the time bell rings  
Goodnight, now it's time to go home  
And he makes it fast with one more thing  
We are the Sultans  
We are the Sultans of Swing

"A long time ago came a man on a track  
Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back  
And he put down his load where he thought it was the best  
He made a home in the wilderness  
He built a cabin and a winter store  
And he plowed up the ground by the cold lake shore  
And the other travelers came walking down the track  
And they never went further, and they never went back  
Then came the churches, then came the schools  
Then came the lawyers, and then came the rules  
Then came the trains and the trucks with their loads  
And the dirty old track was the telegraph road  
  
Then came the mines, then came the ore  
Then there was the hard times, then there was a war  
Telegraph sang a song about the world outside  
Telegraph road got so deep and so wide  
Like a rolling river  
  
And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze  
People driving home from the factories  
There's six lanes of traffic  
Three lanes moving slow  
  
I used to like to go to work, but they shut it down  
I've got a right to go to work, but there's no work here to be found  
Yes, and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed  
We're gonna have to reap from some seed that's been sowed  
And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles  
They can always fly away from this rain and this cold  
You can hear them singing out their telegraph code  
All the way down the telegraph road  
  
You know, I'd sooner forget, but I remember those nights  
When life was just a bet on a race between the lights  
You had your head on my shoulder, you had your hand in my hair  
Now you act a little colder, like you don't seem to care  
But believe in me, baby, and I'll take you away  
From out of this darkness and into the day  
From these rivers of headlights, these rivers of rain  
From the anger that lives on the streets with these names  
'Cause I've run every red light on memory lane  
I've seen desperation explode into flames  
And I don't want to see it again  
  
From all of these signs saying, ""sorry, but we're closed""  
All the way  
Down the telegraph road

"Well it's a strange old game - you learn it slow  
One step forward and it's back to go  
You're standing on the throttle  
You're standing on the brakes

Sometimes you're the windshield  
Sometimes you're the bug  
Sometimes it all comes together baby  
Sometimes you're a fool in love  
Sometimes you're the louisville slugger  
Sometimes you're the ball  
Sometimes it all comes together baby  
Sometimes you're going lose it all  
You gotta know happy - you gotta know glad  
Because you're gonna know lonely  
And you're gonna know bad

And you're coming on strong  
You start slippin' and slidin'  
And it all goes wrong because  
Sometimes you're the windshield  
Sometimes you're the bug  
Sometimes it all comes together baby  
Sometimes you're a fool in love  
Sometimes you're the louisville slugger baby  
Sometimes you're the ball  
Sometimes it all comes together baby  
Sometimes you're going lose it all  
One day you got the glory  
One day you got none  
One day you're a diamond  
And then you're a stone  
Everything can change  
In the blink of an eye  
So let the good times roll  
Before we say goodbye, because  
Sometimes you're the windshield  
Sometimes you're the bug  
Sometimes it all comes together baby  
Sometimes you're a fool in love  
Sometimes you're the louisville slugger baby  
Sometimes you're the ball  
Sometimes it all comes together baby  
Sometimes you're going lose it all

"Heard a bell being toll  
Before the break of day  
I heard then my name being called  
Down that long highway

You don't get long  
You don't get long to stay  
  
Kissing me once and I'll be gone

Spare a thought for the vagabond  
Down that long highway  
Down that long highway

And in the wars I used to play  
And I've called the tune to many a torture session  
Now they say I am a war criminal  
And I'm fading away  
Father, please hear my confession  
  
I have legalized robbery  
And called it relief  
I have run with the money  
I have hid like a thief  
Rewritten histories with armies and my crooks  
Invented memories  
I did burn all the books  
And I can still hear his laughter  
And I can still hear his song  
The man's too big  
The man's too strong  
  
Well, I've tried to be meek  
I have tried to be mild  
But I spat like a woman  
And I sulked like a child  
Hid behind walls that have made me alone  
Striven for peace  
Which I never have known  
And I can still hear his laughter  
And I can still hear his song  
The man's too big  
The man's too strong  
  
Well, the sun rose on the courtyard  
And we all did hear him say  
""You always was a Judas,  
But I got you anyway.  
You may have got your silver  
But I swear upon my life  
Your sister gave me diamonds  
And I gave 'em to your wife.""

Crying out for some soothing rain  
I believe I have taken enough  
I need a little water of love  
  
Water of love deep in the ground  
No water here to be found  
Some day baby when the river runs free  
It'll carry that water of love to me  
  
There's a bird up in a tree sitting up high  
Waiting for me to die  
If I don't get some water soon  
I'll be dead and gone in the afternoon

Once I had a woman now my woman is gone  
Once there was a river now there's a stone
