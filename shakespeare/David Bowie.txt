"I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town where the people I knew  
I had the feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've ever known  
A foggy day in a london town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The british museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles had'nt passed  
For suddenly I saw you there  
And through foggy london town the sun was shining everywhere

Bent on a windfall rent a sony  
Wonder how the dollar went down  
Gotta get a word to Elizabeth's father  
Hey no, he wished me well

Pushing my luck, gonna fly like a mad thing  
Bare strip takeoff skimming over Rhino  
Born in slumber less than peace  
Struggle with a child whose screaming dreaming  
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine  
Sick of you, sick of me  
Lust for the free life  
Quashed and maimed  
Like a valuable loved one  
Left unnamed

Seemed like another day  
I could fly into the eye of god on high

Sunshine on the wasteland  
Old man sitting in the white sand  
Think we're in for a big surprise  
Right between the eyes  
  
Seemed a good idea  
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here  
Only one man could be seen  
And he was old and so serene  
Captain sat in his deck chair  
And the red light flashed Beware  
Pilot felt quite big-time  
As the bomb sailed through the air  
Well, they danced and sang  
When the bang went bang  
When the lights popped out  
And the smoke began to clear  
It was positively queer

""Die"" said the General  
""Cobblers"" said the man  
So the Pentagon sent a cable  
And the Queen a telegram  
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones  
Ripped apart that sand  
'Til the stench was just revolting  
And the sky a greenish tan  
But the soldier said ""Sir,  
There's a crack in the world""  
And the figures went ""squash"",  
And the bits flew far and wide  
How the universe sighed!

When the smoke had blown away  
There was nothing left to view  
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you  
Floating high up in the sky

Don't let me know we're invisible

Cold cold nights under chrome and glass  
Led me down river of perfumed limbs  
Sent me to the streets with the good time girls

Owned by an Austrian  
He often calls me down to eat  
And he jokes about his broken English,  
Tries to be a friend to me  
But for all my years  
Of reading conversation,  
I stand without a word to say  
  
I can't see the bridge  
For the rain in my eyes  
Ahhh-huh, h... Uh, huh  
  
And the world is full of life  
Full of folk who don't know me  
And they walk in twos or threes or more  
While the light  
That shines above the grocer's store  
Investigates my face so rudely  
And my essays lying  
Scattered on the floor  
Fulfill their needs just by being there  
And my hands shake, my head hurts,  
My voice sticks inside my throat  
I'm invisible and dumb  
No-one will recall me  
  
And I can't see the water  
Through the tears in my ey-y-yes  
Ahhh-huh, h... Uh, huh

"I bless you madly,  
Sadly as I tie my shoes  
I love you badly,  
Just in time, at times, I guess  
Because of you I need to rest  
Because it's you  
That sets the test  
  
So much has gone  
And little is new  
And as the sparrow sings  
Dawn chorus for  
Someone else to hear  
The Thinker sits alone growing older  
And so bitter  
  
""I gave Them life  
I gave Them all  
They drained my very soul  
...Dry  
I crushed my heart  
To ease their pains  
No thought for me remains there  
Nothing can they spare  
What of me?  
Who praised their efforts  
To be free?  
Words of strength and care  
And sympathy  
I opened doors  
That would have blocked their way  
I braved their cause to guide,  
For little pay  
  
I ravaged at my finance just for those  
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility  
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free  
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me""  
  
I bless you madly,  
Sadly as I tie my shoes  
I love you badly, just in time,  
At times, I guess  
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes  
Because it's you  
That sets the test  
  
So much has gone  
And little is new  
And as the sunrise stream  
Flickers on me,  
My friends talk  
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word  
  
""We had a friend, a talking man  
Who spoke of many powers that he had  
Not of the best of men, but ours  
  
We used him  
We let him use his powers  
We let him fill our needs  
Now we are strong  
  
And the road is coming to its end  
Now the damned have no time to make amends  
No purse of token fortune stands in our way  
The silent guns of love  
Will blast the sky  
We broke the ruptured structure built of age  
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage  
  
Where money stood  
We planted seeds of rebirth  
And stabbed the backs of fathers  
Sons of dirt  
  
Infiltrated business cesspools  
Hating through our sleeves  
Yea, and we slit the Catholic throat  
Stoned the poor  
On slogans such as  
  
'Wish You Could Hear'  
'Love Is All We Need'  
'Kick Out The Jams'  
'Kick Out Your Mother'  
'Cut Up Your Friend'  
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'  
  
And we know the flag of love is from above  
And we can force you to be free  
And we can force you to believe""  
  
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain  
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain  
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain  
It said:  
""I believe in the power of good  
I believe in the state of love  
I will fight for the right to be right  
I will kill for the good of the fight for the right to be right""  
  
And I open my eyes to look around  
And I see a child laid slain  
On the ground  
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows  
Plowing down man, woman, listening to its command  
But not hearing anymore  
Not hearing anymore  
Just the shrieks from the old rich  
  
And I want to believe  
In the madness that calls 'Now'  
And I want to believe  
That a light's shining through  
Somehow  
  
And I want to believe  
And you want to believe  
And we want to believe  
And we want to live  
Oh, we want to live  
  
We want to live  
We want to live  
We want to live  
We want to live  
We want to live

And die, and lie beside  
She is the apple in my eye

I couldn't cope or'd hope eloped  
A dope she roped this salty lie  
And when she's dreaming, I believe  
And when she's reading, I retreat  
Can't believe her telling me she's dead again  
Telling me she's dead against it  
And deep my wound  
Within for every second chance it was thy tore  
From deep within despite the rain  
My words are worn  
She loves to talk into the phone  
No matter who, no matter when  
No matter where  
No better than the faulty line  
And when she's dreaming, I believe  
And when she's reading, I retreat  
Can't believe her telling me she's dead again  
Telling me she's dead against it

"David Bowie - Fly  
  
The televisions on and I'm walking throught the yard  
How's this life that sweet when I'm crying in the car  
Dying for the weekend  
  
The kids are alright but they don't smell much  
The sellup in the garage in the decks and the stuff  
Dying for the weekend  
  
The boys on a charge but his mother doesn't know  
I never got around yet I tell it my soul  
But we only make it crazy  
  
We'll I'll be fine, I'm only screaming in my head  
But I can fly, I close my eyes and I can fly  
  
The televisions on and I'm walking throught the yard  
How's this life that sweet when I'm crying in my car  
Dying for the weekend  
  
The kids are gonna get it in an all right way  
Looking pretty though but I still want to say  
(Do you really have to go?)  
  
Down in the backstreet the skinny get cries  
Bad judge saturday another life line  
Dying for the weekend  
  
We'll I'll be fine, I'm only screaming in my head  
But I can fly, I close my eyes and I can fly  
When I can fly and fall to all the end and I can fly  
  
I'll be fine, I'm only screaming in my head  
I can fly, I close my eyes and I can fly

"And in the death,  
As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy  
Thoroughfare,  
The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building,  
High on Poacher's Hill.  
And red, mutant, eyes gaze down on Hunger City.  
No more big wheels.  
  
Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats,  
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes,  
Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers,  
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue.  
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now leg-warmers.  
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald.  
Any day now,  
The year of the Diamond Dogs.

This is Genocide.""

Showin' me a hand I knew even the cops couldn't beat

They ride the line of balance and hold on by just a thread  
But it's too hot in these tunnels you can get hit up by the heat  
You get up to get out at your next stop but they push you back down in your

Your heart starts beatin' faster as you struggle to your feet  
Then you're outta that hole and back up on the street  
  
And them South Side sisters sure look pretty  
The cripple on the corner cries out ""Nickels for your pity""

To save my life  
Not to beg or to borrow  
A woman with a feeling  
of loosing once or twice  
Who knows how it could be  
Be tomorrow  
  
I've been waiting for you  
And you've been coming to me  
For such a long time now  
For such a long time now  
A woman with a feeling  
Of loosing once or twice  
Who knows how it could be  
Be tomorrow  
  
I've been waiting for you  
And you've been coming to me  
For such a long time now  
For such a long time now  
For such a long time now  
For such a long time now

"I don't want to lose the good thing that I've got  
If I do, I will surely, I will lose a lot  
  
For your love is better than any love other I've know  
It's like thunder, lightning  
The way you love me is frightening  
I better knock on wood  
Baby  
  
I got superstitious about you, but I can't take change  
You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance  
But your love is better than any other love I've known  
It's like thunder, lightning  
The way you love me is frightening  
You better knock on wood  
  
It's no secret, but that woman fills my loving cup  
She sees, so ready, that I get enough  
And her love is better than any other love I've known  
It's like thunder  
It's like lightning  
The way you love me is frightening  
I better knock on wood  
Baby  
  
Better, yes, better  
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) yes, I better  
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) oh, knock on wood  
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) you know I would, would  
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) it's no secret

Will you stay in our lovers' story  
If you stay you won't be sorry  
'Cause we believe in you  
Soon you'll grow so take a chance  
With a couple of Kooks  
Hung up on romancing  
  
We bought a lot of things  
To keep you warm and dry  
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry  
I bought you a pair of shoes  
A trumpet you can blow  
And a book of rules  
On what to say to people  
When they pick on you  
'Cause if you stay with us you're gonna be pretty Kookie too

And if you ever have to go to school  
Remember how they messed up  
This old fool  
Don't pick fights with the bullies  
Or the cads  
'Cause I'm not much cop at punching other people's Dads  
And if the homework brings you down  
Then we'll throw it on the fire  
And take the car downtown

"She'll come, she'll go. She'll lay belief on you  
Skin sweet with musky oil  
The lady from another grinning soul  
  
Cologne she'll wear. Silver and Americard  
She'll drive a beetle car  
And beat you down at cool Canasta  
  
And when the clothes are strewn don't be afraid of the room  
Touch the fullness of her breast. Feel the love of her caress  
She will be your living end  
  
She'll come, she'll go. She'll lay belief on you  
But she won't stake her life on you  
How can life become her point of view  
  
And when the clothes are strewn don't be afraid of the room  
Touch the fullness of her breast. Feel the love of her caress  
  
She will be your living end  
She will be your living end  
She will be your living end  
She will be your living end

"People stared at the makeup on his face  
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace  
The boy in the bright blue jeans  
Jumped up on the stage  
And lady stardust sang his songs  
Of darkness and disgrace  
  
And he was alright, the band was altogether  
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever  
And he was awful nice  
Really quite out of sight  
  
And he sang all night long  
Femme fatales emerged from shadows  
To watch this creature fair  
Boys stood upon their chairs  
To make their point of view  
I smiled sadly for a love  
I could not obey  
Lady stardust sang his songs  
Of darkness and dismay  
  
And he was alright, the band was altogether  
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever  
And he was awful nice  
Really quite paradise

Because the years of fretting days are right behind you now  
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told  
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds  
I will show you a game where the winner never wins  
Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore  
Let me sleep beside you  
Lock away your childhood and throw away the key  
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals  
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger  
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free  
I will boldly light that lamp and we shall walk together  
Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore  
Let me sleep beside you  
Your darkened eyes throw mystery  
But your lips are void of history  
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you  
I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'll like to hear  
Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore  
Let me sleep beside you

Unskilled hands that knew no trade  
  
Spent his time in the picture house  
The little bombardier  
Frankie drank his money  
The little that he made  
Told his woes to no man  
Friendless, lonely days

Four bright eyes gazed longinly  
At the ice-cream in the hand of

Gone his worries, his hopeless maze  
His life was fun and his life was full of joy  
Two young children had changed his aims  
He gave them toffees and played their games  
He brought them presents with every coins he made  
Then two gentlemen called him  
Asked him for his name  
Why was he friends with the children  
Were they just a game?  
Leave them alone or we'll get sore  
We've had blokes like you in the station before

Packed his bags, his heart in pain  
Wiped a tear, caught a train  
Not to be seen in the town again

"I've nothing much to offer  
There's nothing much to take  
I'm an absolute beginner  
And I'm absolutely sane  
As long as we're together  
The rest can go to hell  
I absolutely love you  
But we're absolute beginners  
With eyes completely open  
But nervous all the same  
  
If our love song  
Could fly over mountains  
Could laugh at the ocean  
Just like the films  
There's no reason  
To feel all the hard times  
To lay down the hard lines  
It's absolutely true  
  
Nothing much could happen  
Nothing we can't shake  
Oh we're absolute beginners  
With nothing much at stake  
As long as you're still smiling  
There's nothing more I need  
I absolutely love you  
But we're absolute beginners  
But if my love is your love  
We're certain to succeed  
  
If our love song  
Could fly over mountains  
Sail over heartaches  
Just like the films  
There's no reason  
To feel all the hard times  
To lay down the hard lines  
It's absolutely true

"Words are flowing out like  
Endless rain into a paper cup  
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.  
Pools of sorrow waves of joy  
Are drifting through my opened mind  
Possessing and caressing me.

Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world

Dance before me like a million eyes,  
They call me on and on across the universe.  
Thoughts meander like a  
Restless wind inside a letter box  
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.  
  
Jai Guru Deva. Om  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world

Are ringing through my opened ears  
Inciting and inviting me.  
Limitless undying love, which  
Shines around me like a million suns,  
It calls me on and on across the universe  
  
Jai Guru Deva.

I wish I was taller

Yea, I'm still so afraid on my own

No, I won't feel afraid

Where the thin men stalk the streets  
While the sane stay underground  
  
Day after day

I can fly, I will scream, I will break my arm  
I will do me harm

Just my librium and me  
And my E.S.T. makes three

With all the madmen  
Than perish with the sad men roaming free  
And I'd rather play here  
With all the madmen

As me

When a nation hides  
Its organic minds  
In a cellar...dark and grim  
They must be very dim)

They take some brain away  
Then turn my face around  
To the far side of town  
And tell me that it's real  
Then ask me how I feel  
  
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall  
I'm not quite right at all  
  
Don't set me free, I'm as helpless as can be  
My libido's split on me  
Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy

Roaming free

"In the port of Amsterdam  
There's a sailor who sings  
Of the dreams that he brings  
From the wide open sea  
In the port of Amsterdam  
There's a sailor who sleeps  
While the river bank weeps  
To the old Willow tree  
  
In the port of Amsterdam  
There's a sailor who dies  
Full of beer, full of cries  
In a drunken town fight  
In the port of Amsterdam  
There's a sailor who's born  
On a hot muggy morn  
By the dawn's early light  
  
In the port of Amsterdam  
Where the sailors all meet  
There's a sailor who eats  
Only fish heads and tails  
And he'll show you his teeth  
That have rotted too soon  
That can haul up the sails  
That can swallow the moon  
  
And he yells to the cook  
With his arms open wide  
""Hey, bring me more fish  
Throw it down by my side""  
And he wants so to belch  
But he's too full to try  
So he stands up and laughs  
And he zips up his fly  
  
In the port of Amsterdam  
You can see sailors dance  
Paunches bursting their pants  
Grinding women to porch  
They've forgotten the tune  
That their whiskey voice croaked  
Splitting the night  
With the roar of their jokes  
And they turn and they dance  
And they laugh and they lust  
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts  
And then out of the night  
With their pride in their pants  
And the sluts that they tow  
Underneath the street lamp  
  
In the port of Amsterdam  
There's a sailor who drinks  
And he drinks and he drinks  
And he drinks once again  
He'll drink to the health  
Of the whores of Amsterdam  
Who've given their bodies  
To a thousand other men  
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue  
Their goodness all gone  
For a few dirty coins  
When he just can't go on  
Throws his nose to the sky  
Aims it up above  
And he pisses like I cry  
On the unfaithful love  
  
In the port of Amsterdam  
In the port of Amsterdam

"I recall how we lived  
On the corner of a bed  
And we'd speak of a Swedish room  
Of hessian and wood  
And we'd talk with our eyes  
Of the sweetness in our lives  
And tomorrows of rich surprise...  
Some things we could do  
  
In our madness  
We burnt one hundred days,  
Time takes time to pass  
And I still hold some ashes to me,  
An Occasional Dream.  
  
And we'd sleep, oh so close,  
But not really close our eyes  
'Tween the sheets of summer bathed in blue...  
Gently weeping nights  
It was long, long ago  
And I can't touch your name.  
For the days of fater were strong for you...  
Danced you far from me.  
  
In my madness  
I see your face in mine.  
I keep a photograph  
It burns my wall with time  
Time,  
An occasional dream  
Of mine.  
An occasional dream  
Of mine.  
An occasional dream  
Of mine.

Lit by the glare of an L.A. fire  
I've got a face, not just my race, Bang Bang I've got you babe  
  
Sun comes up and the man goes down  
And the woman comes again  
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear  
Then we jump through hoops, we're divisable now, just disappear  
  
We reach out over race and hold each other's hands  
Then die in the flames singing ""we shall overcome""

Let him call me brother  
Let him put his arms around me  
Let him put his hands together.

And offered you redemption from sin

Because her inner peace was much too loud.

Stuck his gun in Alice's back  
And said 'This is a bust'  
Shone the flashlight in her eyes

Buzz said 'What a wild sensation'  
Guess this must be hallu hallucina cina cina cination hmmm

When you fall in love with eyes dilational la la  
Now they're taking pills and shots

I even go from town to town  
I said I think this rock is grand  
Say I'll be your man  
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down  
  
I met this chick, the other day  
And then to me, she said she'll stay  
I get this pad, just like a cave  
And then we'll have, our living made  
And then I'll lead her on the ground  
My head is spinning round  
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

And then to her I will be true  
I'll buy her furs and pretty things  
I'll even buy a wedding ring

News had just come over, we had five years left to cry in  
News guy wept and told us, earth was really dying  
Cried so much his face was wet, then I knew he was not lying  
I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies  
I saw boys, toys electric irons and T.V.'s  
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare  
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there  
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people  
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people  
I never thought I'd need so many people  
  
A girl my age went off her head, hit some tiny children  
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off, I think she would have killed them  
A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac  
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest, and a queer  
Threw up at the sight of that  
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlor, drinking milk shakes cold and long  
Smiling and waving and looking so fine, don't think  
You knew you were in this song  
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor  
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there  
Your face, your race, the way that you talk  
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

"Up until one century ago there lived,  
In the Zi Duang provence of eastern country  
A glass-like spider.  
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web,  
In weeks creating a macabre  
  
Shrine of remains  
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers,  
Like floors in a building  
  
At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with almost apparent  
Care, were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops.  
One could almost call it an altar.  
When the breeze blew through this construction,  
It produced sounds of wailing, crying.  
Tiny wails, tiny cries.  
  
The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically  
For their mother.  
But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies  
Would survive someone on their own.  
Oh-The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like-a human's.  
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries.  
  
Don't you hear this wasted cry, Life is over you  
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)  
But you've seen who's in heaven. Is there anyone in hell  
(Mummy come back 'cause it's dark now)  
Take care, take care.  
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)  
Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone.  
But you, you've promise in your lovin' eye. God it's dark now.

Spitting the dawn, come come come along before the animals awake  
Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left.  
If your mother don't love you then the riverbed might  
Gone, gone, the water's all gone

"Was walking through the counters of a national concern  
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder  
  
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean  
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared  
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak  
Into the paper bag at her side  
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed  
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind  
  
Crying  
""God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
God may look the other way today  
  
God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good

Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag  
Perspiration trickled down her forehead  
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder  
She was led away bewildered and amazed  
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter  
As her escort asked her softly  
For her name  
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady  
Who had fainted to the whirling  
Wooden floor  
  
Crying  
""God knows I'm good

If there is something  
That I might find  
Look around corners  
Try to find peace of mind,  
I say  
""Where would you go  
If you were me?  
Trying to keep a straight course  
Is not easy""  
  
Somebody special  
Looking at me  
Same kind of reaction  
Wanted to cry with me  
If there are many  
Too easy to say  
When it's love  
It's just a game-ame-ame-ame  
  
I would do anything for you  
I would come all day  
I would swim all the oceans blue  
I would walk a thousand miles  
Reveal my secrets  
More than enough for me to share  
I will put roses around your door  
Sit in the garden  
Growing potatoes by the score  
  
Shake your head girl,  
With your ponytail  
Takes me right back  
[when you were young]  
Throw your precious gifts into the air  
Watch them fall down  
[when you were young]  
  
Your love - could feel you put them on the ground  
It used to fall apart  
[when you were young]  
  
Your love - could feel you put them on the ground  
The hills were higher  
[when you were young]  
  
Your love - could feel you put them on the ground  
The trees were taller then

"Hey Jack, I better shake it off, put her out of my head  
Thinking I balled just another young girl last night  
Oh brother, I left a woman in that morning bed  
Been on that trip so many times  
Good God, was it really yesterday?  
  
I've tried so many, many, many, many, many, many ways  
I've lied and taken off into the day  
Leaving another girl to weep over the breakfast tray  
Loved her before I knew her name, hit me Jack, 'cos I'm  
Gonna love her way  
  
Come back, my babe  
Come back, my babe  
Be holy again, I gave her  
I gave her, maybe, maybe  
Maybe, gotta give her, ooh baby, baby, baby  
  
That kind of love, can only destroy  
I gave her, maybe, maybe  
Get it down if I'm gonna be her baby, 'cos, baby  
Gonna be me, it's gonna be me  
  
There was no rein to check me  
When all of those little things walked on by  
Oh, but I couldn't really stammer out a word  
When that angel stuck in my mind  
Looking for love won't hold me back  
No, I'm gonna love her way  
  
Come back, my babe  
Come back, my babe  
Be holy again, I gave her

Waiting for the telephone to ring  
Wiped out and bitter with a bag clutched in her hand  
All the cars sound like they're pulling in the drive  
No, no, no  
  
I see her now a little tear running down her cheek  
Lost, let down, people looking for me  
I want to race down her street  
And knock hard  
  
Hard, hard on the door until  
Until she breaks down into my arms like a  
Treasured toy and I feel her pain  
I'll be so strong, again and again  
  
Come back my baby  
I'm hold you again, I'll take you  
I'll take you, baby, baby, baby  
Baby, we're gonna have, ooh baby, baby, baby

As lonely as a moon  
Misty and far away  
Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, Boyzone  
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop, (Satellite)  
Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, (Satellite), Boyzone  
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop, (Satellite)  
Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, (Satellite), Boyzone  
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop  
Looking for satellites  
Looking for satellites  
Satellite, Satellite, Satellite, Satellite  
Looking satellites  
Looking satellites  
Where do we go from here?

"Silver leaves are spinning round  
Take my hand as we go down and down and down  
Looking for water  
But I lost God in a New York minute  
Don't know about you but my heart's not in it  
(Looking looking looking)  
I'm looking for water  
I'm looking for water  
(Looking looking looking)  
I can't breathe the air  
Can't raise the fight  
'Cause all we've got left is a beat in the night  
And I'm  
Looking for water  
Looking for water  
Looking for water  
Looking looking  
  
Take my hand as we go down and down  
Leave it all behind nothing will be found  
I'm looking for water  
I'm looking for water  
Looking for water  
(Looking looking)  
I'm looking for water  
Looking everywhere  
Looking for water  
Looking here and there  
I'm looking for water  
I'm looking for water  
Looking for water  
(Looking looking)  
  
I can't live in this cage  
I can't eat this candy  
To the ends of the Earth  
To this pain in my head  
The look in your eyes  
That never means never  
The dawns early light  
Baby dumb is forever  
  
(Looking looking)

Looking for water

I'm looking for water  
Looking for water

"Lucy I know what you're going to going to do  
Oh Lucy look what you're doing I'm doing it too  
Now you're looking for God in exciting new ways  
I say trust Him at once which is something these days  
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
Did the world just explode?  
Don't recognize anyone  
But you've still got me under your thumb  
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
Pursuing your frenzy in Ritz or Savoy  
In this sexual noise, vicious chords offer joy  
You live and you die in the blink of an eye  
Well I can't make you dance  
Dance to the noise  
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do  
Dance to the noise  
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do  
Lucy I know what you're going to going to do  
But you can't buy me off in this serial world  
Who who who died and made you material girl?  
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric goes wrong  
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a postmodern song  
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
Or this shallow orb mugged by reality  
Just a few simple words like I love you, I need you  
Live and you die in the blink of an eye  
Still I can't make you dance  
Dance to the noise  
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do

Slime and snails

"This girl is made of lipstick  
Powder and paint  
Sees the pictures of herself  
Every magazine on every shelf  
  
This girl is maid of Bond Street  
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives  
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs  
  
This girl is a lonely girl  
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus  
Buys the Daily News  
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her  
  
This girl is made of loneliness  
A broken heart  
For the boy that she once knew  
Doesn't want to know her any more  
  
And this girl is a lonely girl  
Every thing she wants is hers  
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with  
All the time, to love, all the time  
  
This boy is made of envy  
Jealousy  
He doesn't have a limousine  
Really wants to be a star himself  
  
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films  
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor  
  
And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars  
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars  
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares  
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs

"The children of the summer's end  
Gathered in the dampened grass,  
We played Our songs and felt the London sky  
Resting on our hands  
It was God's land.  
It was ragged and naive.  
It was Heaven.  
  
Touch, we touched the very soul  
Of holding each and every life.  
We claimed the very source of joy ran through.  
It didn't, but it seemed that way.  
I kissed a lot of people that day.  
  
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon,  
To paint that love upon a white balloon,  
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his  
Brain.  
Satoria must be something just the same.  
  
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and
size.  
We talked with tall Venusians passing through.  
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head  
And away they soared,  
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud.  
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd.  
And we walked back to the road, unchained.

"Burning up each others' love, burning up our lives  
Tried all kinds of working out, miracle goodnight  
Future full and empty knocking on my door  
Ragged limbed and hungry mama  
Miracle no more  
(Skin tell me) turn it around  
(Head tell me) make it alright  
(Nobody dancing)  
Morning star you're beautiful, yellow dime on high  
Spin you round my little room, miracle goodnight  
Evening flower all alone, puzzling capeche  
Haven't got a death wish, just want a little more  
  
CHORUS  
(Skin tell me) turn it around  
(Head tell me) make it alright  
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight  
(Breath tell me) turn it around  
(Heart tell me) make it alright  
  
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe  
I wish I was a sailor a thousand miles from here  
I wished I had a future, anywhere  
I love you in the morning sun, I love you in my dreams  
I love the sound of making love, the feeling of your skin  
The corner of your eyes, I long forevermore  
I never want to say goodnight, miracle goodnight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't want to know the past, I want to know the real deal  
I really don't want to know that  
The less we know, the better we feel  
Morning star you're beautiful, yellow diamond high  
Spinning around my little room, miracle

(Moon tell me) make it alright  
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe  
(Eyes tell me) turn it around  
(News tell me) make it alright
