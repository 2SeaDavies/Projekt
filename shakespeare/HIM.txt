A moment have come before this.  
My heart, so violently beats along.  
Bleeding me to want to end it all.

The one that made all lips go blue.  
  
I read the words on torn down walls  
Reminding me how much I love you.  
  
I weep for the dream in a dream.  
The one that made all lips go blue.  
I leave bleeding yet another day.  
The one that made all lips go blue.

"Should've known how hard it is to stop tearing each other apart  
Separating souls entwined with all these labyrinthine lies  
  
I am dead to you, a shadow doomed  
My love, forever in the dark  
And of all untruths the truest is you  
Too close to my heart  
  
This emptiness I've made my home  
Embracing memories of dreams long gone  
One last caress from the corpse of love is all I want  
Underneath the cyanide sun  
  
We've sailed the seas of grief on a raft built with our tears  
Looking for a way to disappear for a moment from our deepest fears  
  
I'll be drowning you in this river of gloom  
Forever in my heart

The maze of memories stained  
And suck the blood right out of my heart

Written on unhallowed ground  
With dead leaves

To feed the hunger that dreams  
Our needs beyond God's grasp

From cruelty and tenderness embraced  
Saving my soul no more

I did it all just for her

Just me and my poison girl  
I did it all just for her  
I did it all just for her  
And love's heart is death  
For me and my poison girl  
Poison girl  
And love's heart is death  
For me and my poison girl

No one ever thought this one would survive  
Helpless child, gonna walk a drum beat behind  
Lock you in a dream, never let you go  
Never let you laugh or smile, not you  
  
Well, I just want to walk right out of this world  
'cause everybody has a poison heart  
I just want to walk right out of this world  
'cause everybody has a poison heart  
  
Making friends with a homeless torn up man  
He just kind of smiles, it really shakes me up  
There's danger on every corner but I'm okay  
Walking down the street trying to forget yesterday  
  
Well, I just want to walk right out of this world  
'cause everybody has a poison heart  
I just want to walk right out of this world  
'cause everybody has a poison heart  
A poison heart  
A poison heart

Yeah  
  
You know that life really takes it's toll  
And a poet's gut reaction is to search his very soul  
So much damn confusion before my eyes  
But nothing seems to phase me and this one still survives  
I just want to walk right out of this world  
'cause everybody has a poison heart  
I just want to walk right out of this world

"Upon the wings of a dream she rides  
Oh, she comes to me, fills me with life  
Towards the dark side of the moon, we glide  
She sings me a tune on our way through the silvery starlight  
  
I don't wont to wake up this time  
I'm alive on this serpent ride  
  
In the grace of our love we writhe in pain  
Farther into the song I fall, mesmerized  
A drop of her blood tastes like wine  
I answer her call with a rhyme:  
  
""That is not dead which can eternal lie  
Yet with strange aeons death may die""  
  
In your eyes lies the world where I don't wanna go  
You said you'd changed, but I don't believe in miracles  
Since you conquered my heart we've never been apart  
One day we'll close our eyes, open them again  
And discover each other  
  
As I open up my eyes she greets me with a smile  
From her wrists flows wine

To hold you in my sweetest pain and suffering  
Everything's unfair in our lust and war  
Redemption beyond right and wrong  
  
In our hearts love keeps sweet-talking to despair  
And goes on sleepwalking past hope  
All is lost in this war  
And all we can do is to wail and weep to the saddest song  
Sleepwalking past hope  
  
I unlit the light to embrace the dark  
To be near but not to turn into you my darling  
Forever we're lost in our souls' storm  
Reflections of each other's faults  
  
I gave up long ago  
Painting love with crimson flow  
Ran out of blood and hope  
So I paint you no more  
  
My hell begins from the 10th and descends to the circle  
Six hundred threescore and six  
And from there I crawl beneath Lucifer's claws just for one last kiss

"There's a flame that leads all souls astray  
No one's safe from its tender touch of pain

To celebrate the beauty of the grave

Sacrificing all we have  
For a frozen heart and a soul on fire  
We are like the living dead  
Craving for deliverance  
With a frozen heart and a soul on fire  
  
Again we're falling for disgrace  
And hate will shelter us from the rain  
We are enslaved by the sacred heart of shame  
And gently raped by the light of day  
  
Addicted to our divine despair  
The venom of the cross we bear  
The guilt will follow us to death

With a gun loaded with guilt you opened their eyes  
  
Love preys the living and praises the dead  
In the heart of our hearts by death we were wed  
  
Bleed well the soul you're about to sell for passion deranged  
Kiss and tell, baby we're bleeding well  
Bleed well the heart you're about to fail for reasons insane  
Kill and tell, baby we're bleeding well'  
'In hell  
  
'No love lost under her will', I heard you weeping  
And on those words a church was built to keep the pain in  
  
If death is the answer to love's mysteries  
Then bleed on my darling to the sound of a dream

Study and raise the fine shape of an animal  
Out of it's ashes at his pleasure  
  
Unhappy is he to whom the memories of childhood  
Bring only fear and sadness  
Old years of play  
Wretched is he who looks back upon lone hours  
In vast and dismal chambers  
With brown hangings  
And maddening rows of antique books  
  
Watch them in twilight groves

A philosopher may call up the shape of any dead ancestor  
From the dust where into his body has been  
Incinerated incinerated incinerated

"Again the burden of losing rest  
Upon my shoulders  
And its weight seems unbearable  
Your tomb is where your heart is,  
I should have told her  
But within Me a secret so terrible  
  
To cry is to know that you're alive  
But my river of tears has run dry  
I never wanted to fool you, no  
But a cold heart is a dead heart  
And it feels like I've been buried alive by love  
  
If I should die before I wake  
Pray no one my soul to take  
If I wake before I die,  
Rescue me with your smile  
  
If I should die before I wake  
Pray no one my soul to take  
If I wake before I die,  
Rescue me with your smile  
  
The kiss of vanity you blessed me with a spiritual murder  
Fed the gods of war  
Your home is there in the darkness, I should have told her  
Embrace the fire indestructible  
  
To die is to know that you're alive  
And my river of blood won't run dry  
I never wanted to lose you, no  
But a cold heart is a dead heart  
And it feels like I've been buried alive by love

Let me be so dead and gone, so far away from life

"Heartache is knocking on her door  
Shadows dance outside her window  
Tears keep falling on the floor  
As the world around her crumbles  
  
If you want to save her  
First you have to save yourself  
If you want to free her from the hurt  
Don't do it with your pain  
If you want to see her smile again  
Don't show her you're afraid  
Because your circle of fear is the same  
  
Love can be as cold as grave  
A one-way ticket to endless sorrow  
An empire of gentle hate  
Today without tomorrow  
  
It's the circle of regret  
The circle of hate  
The circle of death  
Your circle of fear is the same

Baby just don't close your heart  
Baby just don't close your heart

I know how easy it is to let go  
Surrender to despair lurking at your door  
To lose your soul and all your feelings  
Strength all gone  
And so many things left unsaid and deeds undone  
You've stopped caring  
Cause it's all in vain

And it was clear we couldn't go on  
Then the door was opened and the wind appeared  
The candles blew then disappeared  
The curtains flew then he appeared  
Saying don't be afraid  
  
Come on baby,and we had no fear  
And we ran to him, and we started to fly  
We looked backward and said goodbye  
We had become like they are  
We had taken his hand  
We had become like they are  
  
Come on baby, don't fear the reaper

The veil of broken dreams  
We find her weeping  
  
On her once white wings  
She will be carrying the weight of our deeds  
And she bleeds for love  
Forever gone  
  
Drunk on shadows and lost in a lie  
Killing ourselves a kiss at a time  
Devils dance while angels smile  
Drunk on shadows and lost in life  
  
Finding souls to feed  
The night side of Eden  
We see the struggling  
For her love's  
Last breath and walk off  
  
Drunk on shadows and lost in life  
Killing ourselves a kiss at a time  
Devils dance while angels smile  
Drunk on shadows and lost in life  
  
She's blinded by the fear  
Of life and death and everything in between  
We smile when she cries a river of tears  
A mirror where we see nothing but a reflection of heaven too far away  
  
Drunk on shadows and lost in life  
Killing ourselves a kiss at a time  
Devils dance while angels smile  
Drunk on shadows and lost in life  
So alive

So alive

"I've seen you breathe life into the weakest of hearts,  
And heard you scream out loud the sweetest poem,  
Echoing across the ocean reminding me why I still try  
To hold onto whatever is left of you and I.  
  
Shedding skin to a dying song,  
We hum along to the evening sun 'til we are no more,  
Little deaths to a dying song,  
Sound a lot like life.  
  
I've seen these dreams being crushed by a single thought,  
And felt the envy of sadness engulf all warmth  
Barely alive under ice by exchanging sighs,  
With tomorrow quivering in the loneliest light,  
  
Shedding skin to a dying song,  
We hum along to the evening sun 'til we are no more  
Little deaths to a dying song,  
Sound a lot like life and love,  
Life and love with you  
  
Crawl back into bed tomorrow's trembling at the sight of you and I.  
  
Shedding skin to a dying song  
We hum along to the evening sun 'til we are no more

Break the silence  
Come crashing in  
Into my little world  
Painful to me  
Pierce right through me  
Can't you understand  
Oh my little girl  
  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever needed  
Is here in my arms  
Words are very unnecessary  
'cause they can only do harm  
  
Vows are spoken  
To be broken  
Feelings are intense  
Words are trivial  
Pleasure remain  
So does the pain  
Words are meaningless  
And forgettable  
  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever needed  
Is here in my arms  
Words are very unnecessary  
'cause they can only do harm

Now you wait your turn, you know there's no return  
Take your written rules, you join the other fools  
Turn to something new, now it's killing you

Disillusioning, you push the needle in  
From life you escape, reality's that way  
Colours in your mind satisfy your time

To take the sleep that you don't know  
You're giving Death a kiss,  
Oh, little fool now

Your body's looking ill  
To you it's shallow leisure  
So drop the acid pill, don't stop to think now  
  
You're having a good time baby  
But that won't last  
Your mind's all full of things  
You're living too fast

Don't bottle it in

To stick the needle in, yeah

Your eyes no longer seeing life's reality  
Push the needle in, face death's sickly grin  
Holes are in your skin, caused by deadly pin

Feel your body heave, Death's hands starts to weave

Price of life you cry, now you're gonna die!

It's my final mistake she's loving by proxy  
No give and all take 'cos I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times.

"Memories sharp as daggers  
Pierce into the flesh of today  
The suicide of love took away all that matters  
And buried the remains in an unmarked grave in your heart  
  
With the venomous kiss you gave me, I'm killing loneliness  
With the warmth of your arms, you saved me  
Oh, I'm killing loneliness with you  
The killing loneliness that turned my heart into a tomb  
I'm killing loneliness  
  
Nailed to the cross together  
As solitude begs us to stay  
Disappear with a lie forever  
And denounce the power of death over our souls and secret brings us in to
start a war  
  
With the venomous kiss you gave me, I'm killing loneliness  
With the warmth of your arms, you saved me  
Oh, I'm killing loneliness with you  
The killing loneliness that turned my heart into a tomb  
I'm killing loneliness  
  
Killing loneliness  
I'm killing loneliness  
With the venomous kiss you gave me, I'm killing loneliness  
With the warmth of your arms, you saved me

Not really sure if I'll live or die  
I wanna leave but I can't get away  
It's a strange sensation  
Out of control bein' by myself  
I feel this gravitation  
Caught like a magnet and I'm bein' pulled (Into the void)  
I wanna get away, get away (Into the void)  
I'm bein' pulled, I'm bein' pulled down (Into the void)  
This place is spinnin', spinnin' around (Into the void)  
Fell like I'm bein' pulled into a black hole  
This crazy feelin's screwin' with my head  
I'm overloadin' and my gauges are red  
State of confusion's got a hold on me  
I feel a hesitation  
I'm bein' drugged, fallen out of the track  
Don't like the situation  
Caught like a magnet and I'm bein' pulled (Into the void)  
I wanna get away, get away (Into the void)  
My head is spinnin', spinnin' around 'round (Into the void)  
This force is gettin', gettin' stronger (Into the void)  
Fell like I'm bein' pulled into a black hole (Into the void)  
I'm bein' pulled, bein' pulled down down  
Down down  
I wanna really get away (Into the void)  
Don't like this feelin', I'm bein' pulled down (Into the void)  
I wanna get away, get away (Into the void)

"Confusion writhes around our hearts impatiently  
It drains the faith that lights the dark and sets us free  
From the chains of our war and the pain we once called love  
The poison of doubt enslaves our minds and we bleed  
We abandon the trust that kept us blind and disappear  
Under the crimson wings of hate where the lost are safe  
Until they love again  
The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there  
And that hope will be our love's requiem  
We pray to the serpent of delight desperately  
The questions are answered and we try not to weep  
Until we are sure we're suffering for love  
In the dungeon of our dreams we're so weak  
The promise made to be broken still haunts our sleep  
We won't open our eyes afraid we would die for love again  
  
The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there  
And that hope will be our love's requiem  
The salvation we seek will be waiting us there  
In the heart of darkness lonely and scared  
With a promise of death for our love  
And now that we're free from the chains of our dark love  
I'm lost  
And now that we're free from the chains of our dark love  
I'm lost

As my voice leaves these stains  
Like the tears that never got to drop  
Let me devour your pain  
Till hurts to touch like crane  
And the words become a roof to shelter us  
  
My words become a roof to shelter us  
Now I've seen the side of my soul  
Now I've found what I was searching for  
Now I'll take you for a ride all the way to the world Behind these rotting,
holes  
  
I, I instill in me  
This world's pressuring  
I, I, I can breathe  
All the insanity  
I, I instill in me  
This world's pressuring  
I, I, I can breathe  
All the insanity  
  
Ooh, cruelty is our song  
Ooh, sins are sins to wash off  
  
Now I've seen the side of my soul  
Now I've found what I was searching for  
Now I'll take you for a ride all the way to the world Behind these rotting,
holes  
  
I, I instill in me  
This world's pressuring  
I, I, I can breathe  
All the insanity  
I, I instill in me  
This world's pressuring  
I, I, I can breathe  
All the insanity

"You can't escape the wrath of my heart  
Beating to your funeral song  
All faith is lost and hell, regained  
In the dust of the wrath of shame, just be brave  
  
Let me wake in the sun of my heart  
We move along this path in the dark  
Where I belong until my feet grow cold  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold me like you held onto life  
When all fears came alive and entombed me  
Love me like you love the sun  
Scorching the blood in my vampire heart  
  
I'll be the thorn in every rose you give  
Sin my woe, I am the nightmare waking you up  
From the dream, the dream of love  
  
And paint you my soul, scarred and alone  
I wait for your kiss to take me home  
  
[Chorus]

"
"Leave all behind now to watch her crawl  
Through our dark gardens of insanity  
She'll be the light to guide you back home  
Just give her a kiss worth dying for  
And open your arms  
  
[Chorus]  
Watch me fall for you  
My Venus doom  
Hide my heart where all dreams are entombed  
My Venus doom  
All dreams are of you  
My Venus doom  
  
Grieve all your hearts out and she'll writhe enthralled  
In tragic ecstatic agony  
And in her flames we will die some more  
Just show me her life worth living for  
And light up the dark  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hold me inside your infernal offering  
Touch me as I fall  
Don't lose yourself in this suffering yet  
Hold on  
  
Watch me fall for you  
My Venus doom  
Hide my heart where all dreams are entombed  
  
Watch me fall for you  
My Venus doom  
Hide my heart where all dreams are entombed  
My Venus doom  
All tears are of you  
My Venus doom

"
"Her Heaven's a lie to those who threw away the key  
Her God is alive and well when the higher believes  
And you can't bend the river of her dreams  
Or understand the divine words she speaks  
  
Venus denies your severing tides above dark waters  
You can quench her thirst with the fear hiding away from the day  
Venus denies you in your dark waters  
The moon kissed the sun and now we hold her in our blood  
  
Her savior was never on a cross pierced with nails  
Thirty pieces of silver never retraced her mistake  
She'll always be free from the arms of your sins  
That made you weak as your world started crumblin'  
  
Venus denies your severing tides above dark waters  
You can quench her thirst with the fear hiding away from the day  
Venus denies you in your dark waters  
The moon kissed the sun and now we hold her in our blood  
  
(She's in our blood)  
Venus denies your severing tides above dark waters  
You can quench her thirst with the fear hiding away from the day  
The venus denies you in your dark waters  
The moon kissed the sun and now we hold her in our blood  
In our blood  
In our blood  
In our blood  
(She's in our blood)

To make me feel this way

To let me dream of you

"No I won't surrender  
At any cost  
You're something so sweet and tender  
From my heart  
  
Yes I've done my evil  
I've done my good  
Just believe me honey  
I won't let go off you  
  
You are the one  
And there's no regrets at all  
You are the one  
And there's no regrets at all  
  
We've had our share of misfortune  
We've had our blues  
And God is not on our side  
Yes it's true  
We keep forgetting baby  
The others too  
There is no one who can take that away  
From me and you  
  
You are the one  
And there's no regrets at all  
  
You are the one  
And there's no regrets at all

"There are things you should know  
The distance between us seems to grow  
But you're holding on strong  
Oh how hard is it to let go  
Oh so hard to let go

And I'm ready to take your 666 in my heart  
I'm longing for your touch  
And I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart

You don't want it to be true  
But there's nothing you can do  
There's nothing you can do

For love is fading so slowly  
I know it's too late  
Oh my God you're so lonely

I'm waiting for your call  
And I'm ready to take your 666 in my heart  
I'm longing for your touch  
And I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart  
  
In my heart  
In my heart  
In my heart
