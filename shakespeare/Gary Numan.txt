Saving souls perhaps?

And you have worlds to mend.  
So, she died...

If you are my saviour

If you are my glory

If you light my darkness  
Then I'm blind and no one can see me.  
If you are my father  
Then love lies abandoned and bleeding.  
If you are my comfort  
Then nightmares are real and deceiving.  
If you are my answer  
Then I must have asked the wrong question.  
I'd spit on your heaven  
If I could find one to believe in.

I crawled inside. 'where else to go'?  
Could be dead for all you know  
Everyday I died for you  
Valium boys with painted eyes  
Young man need love special  
I don't think I want it at all  
  
Long gone. I recall good times  
I must confess I cried  
Me I retired to a back street flat  
Picture 'eyes in a cold steel frame'  
The freaks arrive.  
Broken needles and blood  
'What you on man to get those eyes'  
  
It's very touching I'm so close to me  
False smiles I've rehearsed for days  
Come inside you won't know I'm wrong  
Give me your heart I'm so quickly gone

"Treated like a refugee  
Never seems to be a place for me  
In my mind there is a scene i see  
My house is burning  
No-one returning  
To a land once free.  
  
Dreaming like a deportee  
Cast away upon the open sea  
No hand of friendship for the likes of me.  
I feel the thunder  
I'm going under  
And i can't get free.  
  
If there is a heaven  
I don't want to hang around this hell.  
I could be an angel  
Let god (slip? )out of heaven back to hell.  
  
And i say  
I wont cry, no more tears  
I wont cry, no more tears  
  
Carry me away from here  
Cut the crying and the see-through tear  
Make emotion dissappear  
My life is changing  
I'm re-arranging  
Everything i feel.

"This heart is empty  
I've barely hidden memories

I wonder, does she think of me?  
I wonder, I wonder  
I wonder, does she call my name?  
I cried  
Don't leave me here alone  
I cried  
Don't leave me, don't leave me  
  
Love is like clock law  
Tick tock my heartbeat  
I was a passion that passed her spare time  
  
This room is prison  
Love doesn't come here  
These quiet nights will slowly kill me  
  
I wonder, does she think of me?  
I wonder, I wonder  
I wonder, does she call my name

Remember we toured the skys  
And if the 'friends' all go home  
You know love needs no disguise  
He dances  
And we realised  
Remember  
Love needs no disguise  
In simple embraces  
They lie  
In darkness  
Love needs no disguise  
And we can lock all the doors  
Forget the reasons and fame  
There's no deceiving inside  
You know we'll all be the same

There's a man outside  
In a long coat, grey hat, smoking a cigarette  
  
Now the light fades out  
And I'm wondering what I'm doing in a room like this  
There's a knock on the door  
And just for a second I thought I remembered you  
  
So now I'm alone  
Now I can think for myself  
About little deals  
And issues  
And things that I just don't understand  
A white lie that night  
Or a sly touch at times  
I don't think it meant anything to you  
  
So I open the door  
It's the 'friend' that I'd left in the hallway  
Please sit down  
A candlelit shadow on a wall near the bed  
  
You know I hate to ask  
But, are 'friends' electric?  
Only mine's broke down  
And now I've no one to love  
  
So I find out your reasons  
For the phone calls and smiles  
And it hurts  
And I'm lonely  
And I should never have tried  
And I missed you tonight  
It must be time to leave  
You see it meant everything to me

Sometimes it seems to call my name out loud  
Sometimes it feels like I'm alone  
And then it comes for me again  
  
I'm told it's called 'The unreality dream'  
I'm told it's called 'The great American lie'  
I'm told that this is like the vengeance of God  
I can't believe that God would do this to me  
  
I've known fear many times but nothing like this  
I'm so scared I can't breathe  
I know I'm asleep but I know this is real  
And nothing can help me here  
I'm deep inside something and I may never come back  
And then it was gone  
And then I realized that 'The Rush' brought it in  
And I will never sleep alone again  
  
Sometimes it almost breaks my heart  
Sometimes I swear I hear it laugh at me  
Sometimes it feels like I could die  
And then it leaves my dreams again  
  
Feels like I'm fighting the possession of my soul  
I'm told that this is called 'The sickness of need'  
I've got to cut the sex connection and slide  
A word of warning to the weary and wise

"I remember one girl  
Saw her again in a magazine  
Front cover, big star  
Showing things that I'd never seen

Can you feel it? Can you?  
I remember one girl  
Who'd believe she'd be so devious  
Bad decision, bad move  
She told the papers everything  
Well maybe  
Do you need it, do you?  
Do you want it, do you?  
Come and get it

Television, good wine  
Leather seats and a friend of mine  
Well maybe  
Something's coming  
Oh no

For all humanity?

Lose your eyes for me.

Burn your soul for me.

Feel like nothing is mine

Faces at random  
I quote people I knew

Moving out of central

Of the mad sane door

"Sometimes things don't work out the way you planned  
Sometimes words don't say the things you mean  
Sometimes you can't explain the way you feel  
Sometimes when we smile we tell the same lie  
  
With a whisper, everything you know  
Is torn away and life just stops  
With a whisper, everything you are  
Just falls apart and dies  
  
And all those things that you meant to change  
Are thoughts lost on the way to this  
And all those sorries you never said  
Are words lost on the wind  
  
Did you ever wonder about the end?  
Did you ever you wish that I was still there?  
Did you ever call my name by mistake?  
Did you ever cry yourself to sleep?

Slowly, slowly, we lose the care that holds us  
Slowly, slowly, we lose the time that shares us  
Slowly, slowly, we lose the heart to save us

Sometimes friends are not the friends they seem  
Sometimes time is not the cure it seems

Open eyes and wash out 'tear'  
A sign that says 'no exit'  
And 'no-one can save you here'

I could specialize in pictures  
Where nothing's ever right

I'm out of control  
Nothing I can do  
Nothing seems to work  
I'm barely alive  
Got to slow it down  
Got to do something  
Or give in  
Watching us fall  
Trying everything  
Fighting for life  
Running out of time  
I don't have a choice  
I'm riding it in  
I'm inside and I'm trying to get out  
I'm inside and I'm screaming for some help  
And everything's gone wrong  
I'm listening to the sound of my own fear  
I'm listening to the sound of someone's tears  
I'm listening to me  
This is the fear  
This is nothing like  
You could believe  
Panic in my heart  
Like a cold hand  
Pulling at strings  
I'll do anything  
Even pray to God  
Just let me out  
Turn off the machine  
Turn off all the noise  
Turn off the world  
I'm inside and I'm trying to get out  
I'm inside and I'm screaming for some help  
And everything's gone wrong  
I'm listening to the sound of my own fear  
I'm listening to the sound of someone's tears  
I'm listening to me  
I'm inside and I'm trying to get out  
I'm inside and I'm screaming for some help  
And everything's gone wrong  
I'm listening to the sound of my own fear  
I'm listening to the sound of someone's tears  
I'm listening to me  
You learn fast when everything breaks down  
You learn fast when that's all that you can do  
You learn fast or nothing

I've never seen a pretty girl look so tough baby

A whole hour just to make up your face baby  
Closin' time, ugly lights,  
Everybody's inspected  
But you are a natural beauty unaffected  
Did I say an hour?  
My face is red  
I stand corrected

They need walking shadows

Waiting for you to come home  
Waiting for sleep to come

A nervous bride

I like the fame  
Appreciation in the strangest ways

In such things for now  
Don't like to crash, climb, climb

No control somehow

Like cold death  
Here in my heart

I fell for so long for you  
I fell for so long for you

Of the white faced clown

Gone. I won't look back  
She's gone

Age  
Shows no kindness to me

Watch us fall  
We can take some train  
Down to the sea

We are real you can touch  
Just for now  
And then say  
'Hey you, which way is down'  
We are glass, we are glass  
  
We are strong we run though  
We have time  
And to you I'm just  
One of those boys  
We are glass, we are glass  
We are cold  
We're not supposed to cry  
But it's all just a thought  
So here am I  
We are glass, we are glass

Impressions of the floors inviting  
Stay with me, stay with me  
They run past  
With telephones they scream  
Well would you turn all this down  
Turn all this down  
  
You are replaced you are you  
And our dreams are real  
And dreams are all we need  
We are glass, we are glass  
  
We slip down  
And old eyes don't cry for me  
'Cause I doubt I'm and I doubt you  
And never never going to doubt

Personality malfunction

With people that I don't know

At least until the lights go out  
Advertising posters on the wall  
And the young ones singing softly  
  
Do they ever come back  
Or is it always at the wrong time  
I could crawl around the floor  
Just like I'm real  
And move a hand in front of my eyes

Love is a game that we play  
Love is a game  
Love is a game and you lose  
Welcome to Love'

Waiting for the phone to ring  
And I wonder who you're waiting for

There are no good words for this  
There is nothing more that I can do

Lovers are foolish in the dark  
Lovers are fools  
Lovers are foolish and blind  
Welcome to Love'
