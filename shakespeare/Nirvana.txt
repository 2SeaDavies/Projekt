"Why doesn't she need him for a father?  
Not only maidens can occupy my shack  
Goring my manhood turns a man off.  
Like Pepe LePew would say,  
Hey, hey, hey! -- then we clash!  
  
I got my diddly spayed  
  
She laughs about it.  
Shrinking inflections if the wind blows just right.  
Jacking themselves off polyester.  
I wanna jump, this isn't right!  
Hey, when am I getting it back?  
  
I don't know why,  
I got a joke too silly to say.  
Don't touch the balls.  
I got a dick, dick -- hear my fucking hate!  
  
If you're wondering, it's gaining monthly. (If your world is getting ugly)  
Fiberglass insulated, the sky is cotton candy.  
Spawning downstream, El Rancho Ovulate.  
Feeling can't help me romp  
Bill just fuck me, take me anal  
Billy's slit reminds me of someone.  
I'm sick of paying for the love boat  
Tony and Tenille say wanna jump rope  
And I say look!  
  
I got my penis spayed,  
I got a little tail,  
  
I got my dingaling spayed  
Nothing hard  
I gotta be around pussy  
Don't let me fall  
I got a heh-heh...well you can't live  
We got my dingaling spayed

They don't go to heaven where the angels fly  
They go down to the lake of fire and fry  
Won't see 'em again till the fourth of July

She got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth  
She went to her grave just a little too soon  
And she flew away howling on the yellow moon

And they look for a dry place to call their home  
And try to find some place to rest their bones  
While the angels and the devils  
Fight to claim them for their own

Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend  
Which came as a surprise I spoke into his eyes  
I thought you died alone, a long long time ago  
  
Oh no, not me  
I never lost control  
You're face to face  
With the man who sold the world  
  
I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home  
I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed  
I gazed a gazley stare at all the millions here  
We must have died along, a long long time ago  
  
Who knows? Not me  
I never lost control  
You're face to face  
With the man who sold the world  
  
Who knows? Not me  
We never lost control  
You're face to face

"It's an alliance...  
It's another lie... I'd say  
  
Fall in love tonight  
Even if my eyes  
Even though sometime  
I'm burning out tonight  
  
It's another thing that I'll write  
Feeling like I'll die by myself  
Why?  
  
It's mad enough tonight  
And for it's never cold  
  
It's not a right  
When I can, nevermind  
It's all mine...  
It's all mine...  
Inside I hide  
  
But I'd never mind...  
  
Then... I said...  
Minerals will make... The world  
If we did not have chemicals  
You would not be writing my...  
Death...

Fighting is my friend  
My dog left me  
Yes I'm sad  
One more day, then I can climb inside, safe from you?  
  
Fighting isn't my friend  
When I will never have my friend  
Fighting silence as a friend  
I'm silent and I can't turn it around  
  
And she improvised  
Cause she was supervised  
And I was idolized  
I was idolized  
For those... For those... For those...  
I was aroused and fucked  
  
Finally...  
And I...  
Was in my trap  
And I...  
Another guy  
And a knife...

Steaming, soon begins to melt  
Nothin' really bothers her  
She just wants to love herself
